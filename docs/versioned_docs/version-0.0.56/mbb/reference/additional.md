## Utilities & helpers

### `most_recent_mbb_season()` {#most_recent_mbb_season}

Return the most recent men's college basketball season year.

following calendar year (e.g. October 2025 returns `2026`).

**Returns**

The most recent / current season year.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb import most_recent_mbb_season, espn_mbb_schedule
season = most_recent_mbb_season()
sched = espn_mbb_schedule(dates=season)
```
