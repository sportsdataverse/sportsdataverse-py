### `espn_nba_player_stats(athlete_id: 'int', season: 'int', *, season_type: 'str' = 'regular', total: 'bool' = False, raw: 'bool' = False, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False, **kwargs: 'Any') -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame | dict[str, Any]'` {#espn_nba_player_stats}

Pull an NBA athlete's ESPN **season** stat line as one wide row.

See `sportsdataverse.wbb.espn_wbb_player_stats` for full
documentation of the wide return shape, the `{category}_{stat}` stat
columns, the athlete / team metadata blocks, and the `season_type` /
`total` parameters. For the richer multi-category web-v3 payload use

## Utilities & helpers

### `most_recent_nba_season()` {#most_recent_nba_season}

Return the most recent NBA season year based on today's date.

The NBA season crosses calendar years -- a season started in October of
year Y is reported as season Y+1. If today is in October or later, this
returns next calendar year; otherwise it returns the current calendar year.

**Returns**

The most recent NBA season year (e.g. 2024 for the 2023-24 season).

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import most_recent_nba_season
year = most_recent_nba_season()
print(year)

# Combine with the loaders for a "current season" pull

from sportsdataverse.nba import load_nba_schedule, most_recent_nba_season
sched = load_nba_schedule(seasons=[most_recent_nba_season()])
```

### `year_to_season(year)` {#year_to_season}

Convert a season-end year (e.g. 2024) to the NBA's hyphenated label

(e.g. `"2023-24"`).

Handles century rollover (1999 -> `"1999-00"`) and zero-pads the
second half of the label.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `year` | `int` |  | The starting calendar year of the season (e.g. 2023 for the 2023-24 season). |

**Returns**

NBA-style season label.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import year_to_season
label = year_to_season(2023)
print(label)  # "2023-24"

# Century rollover

print(year_to_season(1999))  # "1999-00"
```
