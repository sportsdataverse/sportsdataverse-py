| API Parameter | Python | Pattern | Required | Nullable | Description |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| `DateFrom` | `date_from_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `DateTo` | `date_to_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `GameID` | `game_id_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `GameSegment` | `game_segment_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `GroupQuantity` | `group_quantity` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `LastNGames` | `last_n_games` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `LeagueID` | `league_id` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `Location` | `location_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `MeasureType` | `measure_type_detailed_defense` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `Month` | `month` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `OpponentTeamID` | `opponent_team_id` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `Outcome` | `outcome_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `PORound` | `po_round_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `PaceAdjust` | `pace_adjust` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `PerMode` | `per_mode_detailed` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `Period` | `period` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `PlusMinus` | `plus_minus` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `Rank` | `rank` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `Season` | `season` |  |  | `Y` | Season year, e.g. ``2024``. Defaults at call time by a calendar cutoff, the month after a season's first games, so it can lag the newest rows by a few weeks. A WNBA season tips off in mid-May and becomes the default in June (``2025`` through May 2026, ``2026`` from June 2026); a draft (``drafthistory``, mid-April) in May. With season type ``Playoffs`` (or ``commonplayoffseries``) the WNBA rolls over in October, after its mid-September playoffs start; with ``All Star`` in August, after the July game. A month table cannot follow a lockout or pandemic calendar: pass a season then. Without one stats.wnba.com answers an empty HTTP 500 or every season summed. |
| `SeasonSegment` | `season_segment_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `SeasonType` | `season_type_all_star` |  |  | `Y` | Season type, a label: ``Regular Season``, ``Pre Season``, ``Playoffs`` or ``All Star`` (each endpoint takes a subset). Not ESPN's numeric code: ``3`` is HTTP 400. A default season follows it: ``Playoffs`` rolls over in October, ``All Star`` in August. |
| `ShotClockRange` | `shot_clock_range_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `TeamID` | `team_id` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `VsConference` | `vs_conference_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `VsDivision` | `vs_division_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
