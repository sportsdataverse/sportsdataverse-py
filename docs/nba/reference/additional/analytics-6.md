### nba_situational_team_games {#nba_situational_team_games}

`nba_situational_team_games(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', season_type: 'str' = 'regular-season', top_n: 'int | None' = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Team splits by situation, one game at a time: `nba_situational_team` per game.

The same possessions and labels, grouped by game too, so a team-season's rows of a split add
up to its `nba_situational_team` row (`games`, `seconds`, `poss`, `opp_poss`,
`pts`, `opp_pts`). The `opponent` family keeps the season's top `top_n`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2026` is 2025-26). The WNBA season is its calendar year. |

`nba_stint_rows(pbp: 'pl.DataFrame', game_lineups: 'pl.DataFrame', possessions: 'pl.DataFrame', schedule: 'pl.DataFrame', *, league_id: 'str' = '00') -> 'pl.DataFrame'`

Map the stats.nba.com releases onto the stint-row frame.

One row per play-by-play action in game order, on the lineup at that action: its clock, its
points (a free throw's on the row of the game's last foul) and the possessions that start at
it. Games not in `schedule` are dropped, and so are possessions whose offense is neither team.

**Parameters**

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import nba_loaders as L
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_game_stints import nba_stint_rows
rows = nba_stint_rows(L.load_nba_stats_pbp(2025), L.load_nba_stats_game_lineups(2025),
                      L.load_nba_stats_possessions(2025), L.load_nba_stats_schedules(2025))
```

### nba_team_clutch {#nba_team_clutch}

`nba_team_clutch(season: 'int', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'`

Opponent-agnostic clutch skill (shrunk clutch net-rating delta) per team.

Loads the season's clutch net rating (`nba_stats_leaguedashteamclutch`)
and full-game net baseline (`nba_stats_leaguedashteamstats`), computes
`clutch_delta`, and applies `shrink_clutch`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `season` | `int` |  | End year of the season (e.g. `2024` for 2023-24). |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA / `"10"` WNBA / `"20"` G-League. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per team: `season, team_id, clutch_net_rating, adj_net_rtg, clutch_delta, clutch_skill_shrunk, clutch_poss`. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it reads stats.nba.com, which answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on; the function works from a residential IP.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_clutch import nba_team_clutch
skill = nba_team_clutch(2024)
skill.sort("clutch_skill_shrunk", descending=True).head()
```

### nba_team_game_four_factors {#nba_team_game_four_factors}

`nba_team_game_four_factors(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', season_type: 'str' = 'regular-season', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Per team and game: the four factors in points against the season's league-average offense.

`pts_vs_exp` (points less a league-average offense on the same counted possessions) split
exactly into `shooting_pts`, `turnover_pts`, `rebounding_pts`, `free_throw_pts` and
`residual_pts`, the possession count's distance from the box estimate beyond the league's.
The prices and the residual's formula are in
`sportsdataverse._common.team_season_rates.team_game_four_factors`; every league value is
the season's (the same possessions as `nba_team_season_rates`) and is on each row.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2026` is 2025-26). The WNBA season is its calendar year. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA or `"10"` WNBA. |
| `season_type` | `str` | `'regular-season'` | `"regular-season"` (default), `"preseason"`, `"playoffs"` or `"play-in"`, matched to the schedule's `season_type`. The league values are that season type's. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id, game_id)`. `team_id` is the stats.nba.com team id (Int64), `game_id` the stats.nba.com game id. `poss` / `pts` are the team's counted possessions and points, `exp_pts` is `lg_ppp * poss` and `pts_vs_exp` the difference; the five `*_pts` columns add up to it (they are null when a league value they use has a zero denominator). `lg_ppp`, `lg_efg_pct`, `lg_tov_pct`, `lg_orb_pct`, `lg_ft_rate`, `lg_ft_pct` and `chance_pts` are the season's league values the factors are priced with. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

| `pts_vs_exp` | Float64 | Points above (+) or below (-) a league-average offense on the same possessions, pts - exp_pts. The four *_pts factors and residual_pts add up to it exactly; they are null (and do not) when a league value they use has a zero denominator or the game has no counts. |
| `shooting_pts` | Float64 | Points from shooting: 2 x (eFG% - lg_efg_pct) x FGA, the same shots above a league-average shooter, plus chance_pts x lg_orb_pct x the rebound chances above the league's per FGA: the misses a league-average offense gets back. |
| `turnover_pts` | Float64 | Points from turnovers: (lg_tov_pct x poss - TOV) x chance_pts, the turnovers saved, each a chance. |
| `rebounding_pts` | Float64 | Points from offensive rebounding: (OREB - lg_orb_pct x (OREB + opponent DREB)) x chance_pts, the extra offensive rebounds on the team's own rebound chances, each a new chance. |
| `free_throw_pts` | Float64 | Points from free throws: (FTA - lg_ft_rate x FGA) x (lg_ft_pct - 0.44 x chance_pts), the extra free throws at a league-average make less the share of a chance each uses, plus FTM - lg_ft_pct x FTA, the makes above league FT%. |
| `residual_pts` | Float64 | The remainder, exactly chance_pts x (box_poss - poss - FGA x the league's box_poss - poss per FGA), box_poss = FGA - OREB + TOV + 0.44 FTA: the counted possessions' distance from the box estimate beyond the league's. Sums to zero over the league. |
| `lg_ppp` | Float64 | League points per counted possession in the season, over the priced team-games (those with all their counts). |
| `lg_efg_pct` | Float64 | League effective field-goal percentage in the season, (FGM + 0.5 3PM) / FGA over the priced team-games (those with all their counts). |
| `lg_tov_pct` | Float64 | League turnovers per counted possession in the season, over the priced team-games (those with all their counts). |
| `lg_orb_pct` | Float64 | League offensive-rebound percentage in the season, OREB / (OREB + opponent DREB) over the priced team-games (those with all their counts). |
| `lg_ft_rate` | Float64 | League free-throw rate in the season, FTA / FGA over the priced team-games (those with all their counts). |
| `lg_ft_pct` | Float64 | League free-throw percentage in the season, FTM / FTA over the priced team-games (those with all their counts). |
| `chance_pts` | Float64 | Points a chance is worth, lg_ppp / (1 - lg_tov_pct): a possession that does not end in a turnover. The price of a turnover saved and of an extra offensive rebound. |

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |

```

### nba_team_game_possessions {#nba_team_game_possessions}

`nba_team_game_possessions(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', season_type: 'str' = 'regular-season', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Per team and game: the possession counts behind `nba_team_season_rates`.

The season table's `poss` / `opp_poss` / `pts` / `opp_pts` one game at a time, from the
same possessions, so a team-season's rows of a split add up to its season row exactly (their
count is `games`). Rate any set of games the same way: sum the rows, then divide once
(`off_rtg = 100 * pts / poss`; pace `48 * 60 * (poss + opp_poss) / 2 / seconds`, 40 in the
WNBA). The definitions are in `sportsdataverse._common.team_season_rates`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2026` is 2025-26). The WNBA season is its calendar year. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA or `"10"` WNBA. |
| `season_type` | `str` | `'regular-season'` | `"regular-season"` (default), `"preseason"`, `"playoffs"` or `"play-in"`, matched to the schedule's `season_type`. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id, game_id, split)`: a game has an `all` row, a `home` or `away` row (neither at a neutral site) and, when it has clutch possessions, `close` and `clutch` rows. `team_id` is the stats.nba.com team id (Int64), `game_id` the stats.nba.com game id. `poss` / `opp_poss` are the team's offensive / defensive possessions, `pts` / `opp_pts` their points and `seconds` the game clock they used. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `season` | Int64 | Season, named by the year it ends (2026 is 2025-26). |
| `team_id` | Int64 | stats.nba.com team id (the 10-digit franchise id). |
| `game_id` | String | stats.nba.com game id. The game this row's possessions are from. |
| `split` | String | The season table's split this game is in: all (every game); home or away (neither at a neutral site); close and clutch when the game has clutch possessions. A team-season's rows of a split add up to its nba_team_season_rates row. |
| `poss` | Int64 | Offensive possessions in the split, counted from possession rows. |
| `opp_poss` | Int64 | Defensive possessions in the split (the opponents' offensive possessions). |
| `pts` | Int64 | Points scored on the team's offensive possessions in the split. Counted from each possession's made shots and free throws. |
| `opp_pts` | Int64 | Points allowed on the team's defensive possessions in the split. |
| `seconds` | Float64 | Game-clock seconds the team's possessions in the split used; pace over a set of games is regulation minutes x 60 x (poss + opp_poss) / 2 / summed seconds. |

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If `league_id` is not `"00"` or `"10"`, or `season_type` is not one of the four above. |

**Example**

```python
import polars as pl
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_team_season_rates import nba_team_game_possessions
games = nba_team_game_possessions(2026).filter(split="all")
games.group_by("team_id").agg(pl.col("pts").sum() * 100 / pl.col("poss").sum())
```

### nba_team_luck {#nba_team_luck}

`nba_team_luck(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', season_type: 'str' = 'regular-season', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Luck and close-game record: Pythagorean expected wins vs actual wins, and close-game W-L.

One row per team and season. `exp_wins` is the Pythagorean expectation on the season's
final scores, `games * pts^x / (pts^x + opp_pts^x)`, with the exponent `x` fitted per
league on past seasons (`~sportsdataverse._common.team_luck.PYTHAG_EXPONENT`).
`luck_wins` is `wins - exp_wins`. A close game is one within 5 points at the start of a
possession in play in the last 5:00 of the 4th quarter or in overtime: one that starts there,
or starts before 5:00 and ends after it (stats.nba.com's clutch window; BB-D3's `close` split).
For the WNBA (`league_id="10"`) through 2005, two 20-minute halves, the regulation window is
the last 5:00 of the 2nd half; overtime counts as above.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2026` is 2025-26). The WNBA season is its calendar year. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA or `"10"` WNBA. |
| `season_type` | `str` | `'regular-season'` | `"regular-season"` (default), `"preseason"`, `"playoffs"` or `"play-in"`, matched to the schedule's `season_type`. The exponent was fitted on regular seasons; on a handful of playoff or play-in games `exp_wins` is only indicative. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id)`; `team_id` is the stats.nba.com team id (Int64). `games`, `wins`, `losses`, `pts` and `opp_pts` are from the final scores; `win_pct`, `pythag_win_pct`, `exp_wins` and `luck_wins` (`wins - exp_wins`) follow. `pbp_games` counts the games with published possessions, and `close_games`, `close_wins`, `close_losses` and `close_win_pct` (null with no close game) are the close games among them. `pythag_win_pct`, `luck_wins` and `close_win_pct` have `<m>_rank` (1 = highest), `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile) and `<m>_n` (games, or close games); ranks are within the season, among teams with at least half the most games (`close_win_pct` also needs possessions for half of them and five close games), and null under five teams. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `season` | Int64 | Season, named by the year it ends (2026 is 2025-26). |

| `opp_pts` | Int64 | Points allowed in those games (final scores). |
| `win_pct` | Float64 | Win fraction: wins divided by games, from the final scores. |
| `pythag_win_pct` | Float64 | Pythagorean win fraction: pts^x / (pts^x + opp_pts^x), x = PYTHAG_EXPONENT['nba'] (PYTHAG_EXPONENT['wnba'] with league_id='10'), fitted on past seasons by tools/fit_team_luck_pythag.py. |
| `exp_wins` | Float64 | Expected wins: pythag_win_pct * games. |
| `luck_wins` | Float64 | Luck in wins: wins minus exp_wins. Positive means the team won more games than its scoring says it should have. |
| `pbp_games` | Int64 | Games with published possessions (nba_stats_possessions); close_games is counted among these. A game whose late possessions are missing from the release counts as not close. |
| `close_games` | Int64 | Close games: at least one possession in play with 5:00 or less left (starting there, or starting before 5:00 and ending after it) in the 4th quarter (the 2nd half for league_id='10' through 2005, when the WNBA played two 20-minute halves) or an overtime, the score within 5 as that possession starts (stats.nba.com's clutch window; BB-D3's close split). The margin is the running sum of the possessions' points, so it can drift from the scoreboard: NBA 2025-26 agrees with an independent ESPN play-by-play recount on 1215 of 1229 games. |

| `luck_wins_rank` | Float64 | Rank of luck_wins within the season (the highest value ranks 1; ties average), among teams that played at least half the most games any team played in the season; null for a non-qualifier, a null value, or fewer than five qualifiers, or when every qualifier has the same value. |
| `close_win_pct_rank` | Float64 | Rank of close_win_pct within the season (the highest value ranks 1; ties average), among teams that played at least half the most games any team played in the season, have possessions for at least half their games and played at least five close games (MIN_CLOSE_GAMES); null otherwise, for a null value, or with fewer than five qualifiers, or when every qualifier has the same value. |
| `pythag_win_pct_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of pythag_win_pct within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |
| `luck_wins_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of luck_wins within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |
| `close_win_pct_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of close_win_pct within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |

### nba_team_season_rates {#nba_team_season_rates}

`nba_team_season_rates(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', season_type: 'str' = 'regular-season', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Season team rates from possessions: ORtg/DRtg/net, pace and the four factors, with splits.

One row per team, season and split (`all`, `home`, `away`, `close`, `clutch`).
Clutch is a possession in play with 5:00 or less left (starting there, or starting before 5:00
and ending after it; one that ends at exactly 5:00 is out) in the 4th quarter or an overtime, the
score within 5 as it starts (stats.nba.com's clutch window); a close game is one with a clutch
possession. For the WNBA (`league_id="10"`) through 2005, two 20-minute halves, the regulation
window is the last 5:00 of the 2nd half; overtime counts as above. The full definitions are in
`sportsdataverse._common.team_season_rates`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2026` is 2025-26). The WNBA season is its calendar year. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA or `"10"` WNBA. |
| `season_type` | `str` | `'regular-season'` | `"regular-season"` (default), `"preseason"`, `"playoffs"` or `"play-in"`, matched to the schedule's `season_type`. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id, split)`. `team_id` is the stats.nba.com team id (Int64). `games`, `poss` / `opp_poss` (offensive / defensive possessions) and `pts` / `opp_pts` are the split's totals. The twelve rates are `off_rtg`, `def_rtg`, `net_rtg` (per 100 possessions), `pace` (possessions per 48 minutes, 40 in the WNBA), the four factors `efg_pct`, `tov_pct`, `orb_pct`, `ft_rate` and the same four against (`opp_*`), all fractions. Each rate has `<m>_rank` (1 = best; `def_rtg`, `tov_pct`, `opp_efg_pct`, `opp_orb_pct` and `opp_ft_rate` rank low first; pace ranks high first), `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile) and `<m>_n` (the sample: possessions for the ratings, the clock in regulation games for pace, field-goal attempts for eFG% and FT rate, possessions for turnover rate, rebound chances for ORB%). Ranks are within the season and split, among teams with at least half the most games whose `<m>_n` reaches the league's `~sportsdataverse._common.rate_gates.TEAM_MIN_N` gate (a clutch split reaches none), and null under five teams.
