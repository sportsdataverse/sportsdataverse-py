## nba_stats_playercareerbycollegerollup

GET /stats/playercareerbycollegerollup

**Endpoint URL:** `GET https://stats.nba.com/stats/playercareerbycollegerollup`

**Valid URL:** [https://stats.nba.com/stats/playercareerbycollegerollup?LeagueID=00&PerMode=Totals&Season=2024-25&SeasonType=Regular+Season](https://stats.nba.com/stats/playercareerbycollegerollup?LeagueID=00&PerMode=Totals&Season=2024-25&SeasonType=Regular+Season)

| API Parameter | Python | Pattern | Required | Nullable | Description |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| `LeagueID` | `league_id` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `PerMode` | `per_mode_simple` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `Season` | `season_nullable` |  |  | `Y` | Season label, e.g. ``2024-25``. Defaults at call time by a calendar cutoff, the month after a season's first games, so it can lag the newest rows by a few weeks. An NBA season tips off in late October and becomes the default in November (``2025-26`` through October 2026, ``2026-27`` from November 2026); a G League season (regular season from late December) in January; a Summer League (played in July, which stats.nba.com labels ``2026-27`` in 2026) in August; a draft combine (May) in June; a draft (``drafthistory``, a year; late June) in July. With season type ``Playoffs`` / ``PlayIn`` (or ``commonplayoffseries``) the NBA and the G League roll over in May, after their playoffs start; with ``All Star`` the NBA rolls over in March, after the February game (the G League has no All-Star rows and keeps its own rule). A month table cannot follow a lockout or pandemic calendar (1998-99, 2011-12, 2020-21): pass a season then. Without one stats.nba.com answers an empty HTTP 500 or every season summed. |
| `SeasonType` | `season_type_all_star` |  |  | `Y` | Season type, a label: ``Regular Season``, ``Pre Season``, ``Playoffs``, ``PlayIn`` or ``All Star`` (each endpoint takes a subset). Not ESPN's numeric code: ``3`` is HTTP 400. A default season follows it: ``Playoffs`` / ``PlayIn`` roll over in May (NBA, G League), ``All Star`` in March (NBA). |
