### Returns {#load_nba_player_impact-returns}

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `player_id` | Int64 | Unique player identifier. |
| `player_name` | String | Player name. |
| `team_id` | Int64 | Unique team identifier. |
| `team_abbreviation` | String | Short team abbreviation (e.g. 'LAS'). |
| `team_name` | String | Full team display name (e.g. 'Las Vegas Aces'). |
| `teams` | String | Nested list of member-team membership spans. |
| `season` | Int64 | Season year. |
| `season_type` | String | Season type (1=pre-season, 2=regular season, 3=postseason, 4=off-season for ESPN; or string label for WNBA Stats). |
| `o_rapm` | Float64 | Offensive regularized adjusted plus-minus per 100 possessions from the single-season ridge fit over possession-level lineup indicators; positive means the player raised his team's scoring rate while on offense. |
| `d_rapm` | Float64 | Defensive regularized adjusted plus-minus per 100 possessions, negated from the raw points-allowed coefficient so a positive value marks a defender who suppresses opponent scoring. |
| `rapm` | Float64 | Total regularized adjusted plus-minus per 100 possessions, exactly the sum of o_rapm and d_rapm. |
| `off_poss` | Int64 | Number of possessions the player was on the floor on offense, the count of design-matrix rows carrying his offensive indicator and therefore the offensive-side sample size behind o_rapm. |
| `def_poss` | Int64 | Number of possessions the player was on the floor on defense, the sample size behind d_rapm; it tracks off_poss almost exactly because substitutions rarely split an offense-defense pair. |
| `o_adj_rapm` | Float64 | Offensive regularized adjusted plus/minus after the ridge opponent adjustment. |
| `d_adj_rapm` | Float64 | Defensive regularized adjusted plus/minus after the ridge opponent adjustment. |
| `adj_rapm` | Float64 | Total prior-informed RAPM per 100 possessions, exactly the sum of o_adj_rapm and d_adj_rapm. |
| `ospm` | Float64 | Offensive statistical plus-minus per 100 possessions: the player's per-100 box-score feature vector scored through ridge coefficients trained on that season's o_rapm target. |
| `dspm` | Float64 | Defensive statistical plus-minus per 100 possessions from the same box-score feature vector scored through coefficients trained on the d_rapm target. |
| `spm` | Float64 | Total statistical plus-minus per 100 possessions, exactly the sum of ospm and dspm. |
| `min` | Float64 | Minutes played. |
| `gp` | Int64 | Games played. |
| `obpm` | Float64 | Offensive box plus/minus. |
| `dbpm` | Float64 | Defensive box plus/minus. |
| `bpm` | Float64 | Career box plus/minus. |
| `war` | Float64 | Wins above replacement, computed as (rapm minus a replacement level of -2.0 per 100) times total possessions divided by 100, divided by a points-per-win constant calibrated each season by regressing team wins on full-season point margin. |
| `darko_filtered_skill` | Float64 | DARKO-style Kalman-filtered skill estimate at the end of the player's observed multi-season RAPM panel, i.e. his current-form rating after aging drift and possession-weighted observation noise. |
| `darko_projected_rating` | Float64 | One-season-ahead DARKO forecast, the filtered skill plus the empirical aging-curve drift at the player's last observed age; both season_type rows of a player-season carry the same value because the projection is not playoff-specific. |
| `darko_projected_sd` | Float64 | Standard deviation of the one-season-ahead DARKO forecast, the square root of the filtered state variance plus the Kalman process variance; it sits at roughly 10.19 for a player with only one season in the panel, whose diffuse prior variance was never updated. |
