**Parameters**

| `league` | `str` |  | HockeyTech league code: `"ahl"`, `"ohl"`, `"whl"`, or `"qmjhl"`. |

**Returns**

## Dates and seasons

### ajhl_season_id {#ajhl_season_id}

All AJHL seasons with end-year + game-type labels.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |

| `game_type_label` | character | Game type read from the season name, first match wins: "preseason" (pre-season, preseason), "playoffs" (playoff, post), "exhibition", else "regular". One-off events such as all-star games are labelled "regular" too; season resolution skips them. |

### most_recent_ajhl_season {#most_recent_ajhl_season}

`most_recent_ajhl_season() -> 'int'`

Newest AJHL regular season as an end-year integer: the highest `season_yr` of a regular season that is not a one-off event, so a preseason listed first is not a default. Raises `NoDataError` when the seasons feed lists none, `AssetFetchError` when it fails.
