| API Parameter | Python | Pattern | Required | Nullable | Description |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| `DateFrom` | `date_from_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `DateTo` | `date_to_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `GameSegment` | `game_segment_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `LastNGames` | `last_n_games` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `LeagueID` | `league_id` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `Location` | `location_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `MeasureType` | `measure_type_detailed` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `Month` | `month` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `OpponentTeamID` | `opponent_team_id` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `Outcome` | `outcome_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `PORound` | `po_round_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `PaceAdjust` | `pace_adjust` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `PerMode` | `per_mode_detailed` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `Period` | `period` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `PlayerID` | `player_id` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `PlusMinus` | `plus_minus` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `Rank` | `rank` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `Season` | `season` |  |  | `Y` | Season label, e.g. ``2024-25``. Defaults at call time by a calendar cutoff, the month after a season's first games, so it can lag the newest rows by a few weeks. A G League regular season starts in late December and becomes the default in January (``2025-26`` from January 2026); a draft combine (May) in June. With season type ``Playoffs`` (or ``commonplayoffseries``) it rolls over in May, after the late-March playoffs start; the G League has no All-Star rows. A month table cannot follow a lockout or pandemic calendar: pass a season then. Without one stats.nba.com answers an empty HTTP 500 or every season summed. |
| `SeasonSegment` | `season_segment_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `SeasonType` | `season_type_playoffs` |  |  | `Y` | Season type, a label: ``Regular Season``, ``Pre Season`` or ``Playoffs`` (each endpoint takes a subset; the G League has no ``All Star`` rows). Not ESPN's numeric code: ``3`` is HTTP 400. A default season follows it: ``Playoffs`` rolls over in May. |
| `ShotClockRange` | `shot_clock_range_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `VsConference` | `vs_conference_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |
| `VsDivision` | `vs_division_nullable` |  |  | `Y` |  |

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|

| `ValueError` | The host answered 400 / 422 -- the request is wrong; retrying cannot help. |
| `AssetFetchError` | The fetch failed (a non-2xx answer or a connection failure after retries, e.g. 401/403/429/5xx, or an empty or unreadable 200 body) -- the answer is unknown, not empty. |
| `ImportError` | `curl_cffi` is not installed -- stats.nba.com / stats.wnba.com block plain `requests`, so the transport needs it (`pip install curl_cffi` or `sportsdataverse[all]`). |
