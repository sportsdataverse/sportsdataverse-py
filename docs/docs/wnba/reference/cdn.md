# WNBA — ESPN CDN API (cdn.espn.com)

`sportsdataverse.wnba` — 4 endpoints.

## espn_wnba_cdn_playbyplay

One game's espn.com play-by-play page data. The gamepackageJSON block is a Site v2 summary (header, boxscore, plays or drives, win probability, ...), so the parsed result is the same dict of frames that parse_summary returns.
