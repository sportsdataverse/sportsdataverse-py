### wnba_season_standings {#wnba_season_standings}

`wnba_season_standings(games: 'pl.DataFrame', *, league_id: 'str' = '10', seed: 'int' = 0, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

WNBA standings with the WNBA tiebreakers (league_id='10'). See sportsdataverse.nba.nba_season_rules.nba_season_standings.

**Parameters**

| `seed` | `int` | `0` |  |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` |  |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id)` that played: `conference` / `division` (NBA; the WNBA rows say `"WNBA"`), `games`, `wins`, `losses`, `win_pct`, `point_diff`, `division_rank` (1 = the division winner), `division_leader`, `seed` (rank in the conference for the NBA, in the league for the WNBA, 1 = best) and `games_back` (behind the seed-1 team). Sorted by season, conference and seed.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `season` | Int64 | Season, named by the year it ends (2026 is 2025-26); the WNBA season is its calendar year. |

| `division` | String | NBA division; "WNBA" for every WNBA team. |
| `games` | Int64 | Regular-season games played. |
| `wins` | Int64 | Regular-season wins. |
| `losses` | Int64 | Regular-season losses. |
| `win_pct` | Float64 | Regular-season winning percentage, wins divided by games played; the first key of the seeding. |

### wnba_shot_value {#wnba_shot_value}

`wnba_shot_value(player_ids: "'list[int]'", season: 'str', *, include_context: 'bool' = False, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> "'dict[str, Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]]'"`

WNBA one-call shot-value spine (`league_id="10"`).

Thin wrapper binding `sportsdataverse.nba.nba_shot_value.nba_shot_value`
to the women's league; fetches each player's `shotchartdetail`, scores
per-shot expected points from the free `LeagueAverages` zone table, and
returns the scored shots plus shooter talent, selection quality, and
zone-value maps (and the defender/shot-clock context tables when
`include_context=True`). Women's court geometry + shrinkage constant are
keyed `"10"` in `nba_shot_value_constants`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `player_ids` | `list[int]` |  | Player ids to fetch. |
| `season` | `str` |  | Season string, e.g. `"2024"`. |

| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return pandas frames instead of polars. |

**Returns**

`{"shots", "talent", "selection", "zones"}` (plus `"context"` when requested). An empty fetch returns a dict of zero-row frames.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.wnba import wnba_shot_value
out = wnba_shot_value([1628886], "2024")
out["talent"].head()
```

### wnba_team_luck {#wnba_team_luck}

`wnba_team_luck(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league_id: 'str' = '10', season_type: 'str' = 'regular-season', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `season` | Int64 | Season, the calendar year. |
| `team_id` | Int64 | stats.nba.com team id (the 10-digit franchise id). |

| `pythag_win_pct_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of pythag_win_pct within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |
| `luck_wins_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of luck_wins within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |
| `close_win_pct_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of close_win_pct within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |

### wnba_team_season_rates {#wnba_team_season_rates}

`wnba_team_season_rates(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league_id: 'str' = '10', season_type: 'str' = 'regular-season', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

WNBA season team rates from possessions (league_id='10'). See sportsdataverse.nba.nba_team_season_rates.nba_team_season_rates.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  |  |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'10'` |  |
| `season_type` | `str` | `'regular-season'` |  |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` |  |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id, split)`. `team_id` is the stats.nba.com team id (Int64). `games`, `poss` / `opp_poss` (offensive / defensive possessions) and `pts` / `opp_pts` are the split's totals. The twelve rates are `off_rtg`, `def_rtg`, `net_rtg` (per 100 possessions), `pace` (possessions per 48 minutes, 40 in the WNBA), the four factors `efg_pct`, `tov_pct`, `orb_pct`, `ft_rate` and the same four against (`opp_*`), all fractions. Each rate has `<m>_rank` (1 = best; `def_rtg`, `tov_pct`, `opp_efg_pct`, `opp_orb_pct` and `opp_ft_rate` rank low first; pace ranks high first), `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile) and `<m>_n` (the sample: possessions for the ratings, the clock in regulation games for pace, field-goal attempts for eFG% and FT rate, possessions for turnover rate, rebound chances for ORB%). Ranks are within the season and split, among teams with at least half the most games whose `<m>_n` reaches the league's `~sportsdataverse._common.rate_gates.TEAM_MIN_N` gate (a clutch split reaches none), and null under five teams. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| str \| list` |  | A single season or list of seasons. |

| `per_mode` | `str` | `'Totals'` | `per_mode_simple` passed to the fetch (default `"Totals"`). |
| `by_position` | `bool` | `True` | Compute the baseline within role buckets (default); `False` forces one league-wide bucket. |
| `positions` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Optional pre-fetched positions frame. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of polars. |
