# WNBA — additional Python functions — Analytics: make_prob–wnba_referee

### make_prob_by_context {#make_prob_by_context}

`make_prob_by_context(ptshots: 'pl.DataFrame', *, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> "'dict[str, Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]]'"`

Marginal FG% tables by defender distance and by shot clock.

The public API exposes defender-distance and shot-clock only as aggregate
bucket tables (`playerdashptshots`), not per-shot fields, so this
aggregates `Σfgm/Σfga` across players within each bucket.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ptshots` | `DataFrame` |  | The stacked `playerdashptshots` fixture — one frame with a `result_set` tag (`ClosestDefenderShooting` / `ShotClockShooting`) plus `bucket, fga, fgm`. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return pandas DataFrames instead of polars. |

**Returns**

`{"defender": frame, "shot_clock": frame}` each with rows per `bucket` (`bucket, fga, fgm, fg_pct`). Missing result sets return the zero-row schema.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_shot_value import make_prob_by_context
tables = make_prob_by_context(ptshots)
tables["defender"].sort("fg_pct")
```

### make_prob_joint {#make_prob_joint}

`make_prob_joint(defender: 'pl.DataFrame', shot_clock: 'pl.DataFrame', overall_fg_pct: 'float', *, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

Independence-combined defender x shot-clock make probability.

Combines the two marginal FG% tables under a conditional-independence
assumption via odds multipliers: `odds(p) = p/(1-p)`;
`odds_joint = odds_overall * (odds_def/odds_overall) *
(odds_clock/odds_overall)`; `joint = odds_joint/(1+odds_joint)`. This
assumes defender distance and shot-clock effects are independent given the
league baseline — a simplification (a late clock correlates with tighter
defense), documented here so callers weigh it.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `defender` | `DataFrame` |  | The `"defender"` marginal table from `make_prob_by_context` (`bucket, fg_pct`). |
| `shot_clock` | `DataFrame` |  | The `"shot_clock"` marginal table (`bucket, fg_pct`). |
| `overall_fg_pct` | `float` |  | The league overall FG% baseline. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas DataFrame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(close_def_dist_range, shot_clock_range)`: `close_def_dist_range:Utf8, shot_clock_range:Utf8, joint_fg_pct:Float64`. Empty inputs return the zero-row schema.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: its inputs come from make_prob_by_context on stats.nba.com tracking data, which answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_shot_value import make_prob_by_context, make_prob_joint
t = make_prob_by_context(ptshots)
joint = make_prob_joint(t["defender"], t["shot_clock"], 0.47)
```

### score_shot_xpoints {#score_shot_xpoints}

`score_shot_xpoints(shots: 'pl.DataFrame', league_avgs: 'pl.DataFrame', *, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

Score each shot with expected points from the league-average baseline.

Joins the per-shot frame to the zone baseline (falling back to the
within-`shot_zone_range` mean when a zone triple is unmatched) and adds
`shot_value` (3 for a `3PT` shot else 2), `xpoints = base_fg_pct *
shot_value`, and `actual_points = shot_made_flag * shot_value`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shots` | `DataFrame` |  | Per-shot `Shot_Chart_Detail` frame (needs `shot_type` + the three zone keys + `shot_made_flag`). |
| `league_avgs` | `DataFrame` |  | The `LeagueAverages` frame (see `xpoints_baseline`). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas DataFrame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

The input `shots` plus `shot_value:Int64, base_fg_pct:Float64, xpoints:Float64, actual_points:Float64`. Empty input returns the augmented schema with zero rows.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: its input is the shots frame of wnba_shot_value, which reads stats.nba.com shotchartdetail; that host answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on.

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | A zone join key has a different dtype on the two frames. |

**Example**

```python
import polars as pl
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_shot_value import score_shot_xpoints
scored = score_shot_xpoints(shots, league_avgs)

# Pipeline next step (one line)

scored.group_by("player_id").agg(pl.col("xpoints").sum())
```

### shooter_talent {#shooter_talent}

`shooter_talent(scored_shots: 'pl.DataFrame', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', min_attempts: 'int' = 50, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

Regressed shooter true-talent: make%-above-expected, shrunk to the mean.

Aggregates `score_shot_xpoints` output per shooter and regresses the
raw over-expected rate toward zero by `n/(n+k)` (`k =
get_shrinkage_k(league_id)`, fitted split-half). **As-of leakage
boundary:** to score a shooter's talent for shots after date *D*, pass
only that shooter's shots before *D* -- this function does not enforce the
cut itself.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scored_shots` | `DataFrame` |  | `score_shot_xpoints` output (needs `player_id`, `shot_made_flag`, `base_fg_pct`, `xpoints`, `actual_points`). |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA, `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |
| `min_attempts` | `int` | `50` | Drop shooters with fewer attempts (unstable estimate). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas DataFrame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `player_id`: `player_id:Int64, n_att:Int64, actual_makes:Int64, exp_makes:Float64, points_above_expected:Float64, raw_above_pct:Float64, talent_pct:Float64`. Empty input returns the zero-row schema.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: its input is the shots frame of wnba_shot_value, which reads stats.nba.com shotchartdetail; that host answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_shot_value import score_shot_xpoints, shooter_talent
talent = shooter_talent(score_shot_xpoints(shots, league_avgs))

# Pipeline next step (one line)

talent.sort("talent_pct", descending=True).head(15)
```

### shot_selection_quality {#shot_selection_quality}

`shot_selection_quality(scored_shots: 'pl.DataFrame', *, min_attempts: 'int' = 50, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

Player shot-selection quality: mean expected value vs the league mean.

`xev_per_shot` is a player's mean `xpoints` (the value of the LOOKS
they take, independent of makes); `selection_quality` is that minus the
league-wide mean `xpoints` over the same frame -- a rim-and-three diet
scores positive, a mid-range diet negative.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scored_shots` | `DataFrame` |  | `score_shot_xpoints` output (needs `player_id`, `xpoints`). |
| `min_attempts` | `int` | `50` | Drop players with fewer attempts. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas DataFrame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `player_id`: `player_id:Int64, n_att:Int64, xev_per_shot:Float64, league_xev_per_shot:Float64, selection_quality:Float64`. Empty input returns the zero-row schema.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: its input is the shots frame of wnba_shot_value, which reads stats.nba.com shotchartdetail; that host answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_shot_value import score_shot_xpoints, shot_selection_quality
sel = shot_selection_quality(score_shot_xpoints(shots, league_avgs))

# Pipeline next step (one line)

sel.sort("selection_quality", descending=True).head(15)
```

### wnba_availability {#wnba_availability}

`wnba_availability(seasons: "'int | list[int]'", *, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> "'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'"`

WNBA availability -- the NBA core bound to `league="wnba"`.

See `sportsdataverse.nba.nba_availability.nba_availability` for the
full contract; `avail_pct` is availability, not skill.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season (start year) or list of seasons. |

**Returns**

Frame `player_id:Utf8, season:Int64, avail_pct:Float64`.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it reads stats.wnba.com, which answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on; the function works from a residential IP.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.wnba import wnba_availability
proj = wnba_availability(2023)
```

### wnba_coach_careers {#wnba_coach_careers}

### wnba_matchup_drapm {#wnba_matchup_drapm}

`wnba_matchup_drapm(season: 'str', *, matchups: "'Optional[pl.DataFrame]'" = None, config: "'Optional[PlaytypeConfig]'" = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

WNBA matchup defensive RAPM (`league_id="10"`).

Thin wrapper binding
`sportsdataverse.nba.nba_matchup_drapm.nba_matchup_drapm` to the
women's league.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `season` | `str` |  | Season string, e.g. `"2024"`. |
| `matchups` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Injected `nba_stats_leagueseasonmatchups`-shaped frame. |
| `config` | `Optional[PlaytypeConfig]` | `None` | `~sportsdataverse.nba.nba_playtype_constants.PlaytypeConfig` override. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas DataFrame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

Same schema as `sportsdataverse.nba.nba_matchup_drapm.nba_matchup_drapm`.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it reads stats.nba.com (WNBA league id 10), which answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on; the function works from a residential IP.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.wnba import wnba_matchup_drapm
d = wnba_matchup_drapm("2024")
print(d.sort("matchup_drapm", descending=True).head())
```

### wnba_player_props {#wnba_player_props}

`wnba_player_props(season: 'int', game_id: 'str', home_team_id: 'str', away_team_id: 'str', *, league_id: 'str' = '10', as_of_date: 'Union[dt.date, None]' = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'`

WNBA player props (league_id='10'). See sportsdataverse.nba.nba_player_props.nba_player_props.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

| `as_of_date` | `Union[date, None]` | `None` |  |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` |  |

**Returns**

One row per player on either team: `player_id, team_id, stat_pts_exp, stat_reb_exp, stat_ast_exp, stat_fg3m_exp, pace_proj`. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `player_id` | String | Unique player identifier. |
| `team_id` | String | Unique team identifier. |
| `stat_pts_exp` | Float64 |  |

WNBA Synergy play-type-adjusted offense/defense (`league_id="10"`).

Thin wrapper binding
`sportsdataverse.nba.nba_playtype.nba_playtype_ratings` to the
women's league. Synergy coverage is sparse for the WNBA; an empty upstream
fetch degrades to a zero-row frame (never raises).

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `season` | `str` |  | Season string, e.g. `"2024"`. |
| `off_team` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Injected Synergy offensive team frame (bypasses the live fetch). |
| `def_team` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Injected Synergy defensive team frame. |
| `schedule` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Injected `team_id`/`opp_team_id` schedule frame. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas DataFrame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

Same schema as `sportsdataverse.nba.nba_playtype.nba_playtype_ratings`.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it reads stats.nba.com (WNBA league id 10), which answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on; the function works from a residential IP.

**Example**

```python

### wnba_referee_assignments {#wnba_referee_assignments}

`wnba_referee_assignments(date: 'str | _dt.date', *, raw: 'bool' = False, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False, proxy: 'dict | None' = None) -> 'dict[str, Any]'`

Fetch and parse WNBA referee assignments for a given date from official.nba.com.

Retrieves the referee crew assignments and replay center officials for all WNBA
games on a given date. The `crew_position` column (1–4) represents the feed's
slot order; slot 1 is inferred to be the crew chief. The `season` column is
the WNBA single-year season (feed year converted as-is). This is a thin shim
over `sportsdataverse.nba.nba_officiating.nba_referee_assignments` that
sets `league="wnba"`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `date` | `str \| date` |  | The date to fetch assignments for (str in "YYYY-MM-DD" format or datetime.date). |
| `raw` | `bool` | `False` | If True, return the raw JSON payload (dict) with all three leagues instead of parsed DataFrames. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | If True, return pandas DataFrames instead of polars. |
| `proxy` | `dict \| None` | `None` | Optional proxy dict passed through to the HTTP layer. |

**Returns**

A dict with keys `"officials"` and `"replay_center"` mapping to DataFrames. If `raw=True`, returns the full three-league JSON payload instead.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `officials.league` | String | League the assignment belongs to: nba, gl (G League), or wnba. |
| `officials.game_id` | String | 10-digit game id (zero-padded) for the assigned game. |
| `officials.game_date` | Date | Game date parsed from the feed's MM/DD/YYYY format. |
| `officials.season` | Int64 | Season end year, converted from the feed's <season-type digit><start year> code: start year + 1 for NBA/G League's two-calendar-year seasons, start year unchanged for WNBA's single-year seasons. |
| `officials.season_type` | String | Season type decoded from the feed's season code first digit: preseason, regular, all-star, playoffs, play-in, or nba-cup-final. |
| `officials.game_code` | String | League game code in YYYYMMDD/AWYHOM format, matching the away and home team abbreviations. |
| `officials.home_team_id` | Int64 | 10-digit team id of the home team. |
| `officials.home_team_abbr` | String | Three-letter abbreviation of the home team. |
| `officials.away_team_id` | Int64 | 10-digit team id of the away team. |
| `officials.away_team_abbr` | String | Three-letter abbreviation of the away team. |
| `officials.crew_position` | Int64 | Feed's official slot order (1-4); slot 1 is inferred to be the crew chief since the API does not label roles. |
| `officials.official_id` | Int64 | Numeric official id from the feed (source field official{n}_code); expected to match stats.nba.com's OFFICIAL_ID. |
| `officials.official_name` | String | Official's display name for this crew slot. |
| `officials.jersey_num` | String | Official's jersey number as a string, from the feed's official{n}_JNum field. |
| `replay_center.league` | String | League the replay-center staffing belongs to: nba, gl, or wnba. |
| `replay_center.game_date` | Date | Date the replay-center official worked; a date-level staffing record, not tied to one game. |
| `replay_center.official_id` | Int64 | Numeric replay-center official id from the feed. |
| `replay_center.official_name` | String | Replay-center official's display name for that date. |

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | `date` is not a valid "YYYY-MM-DD" date (checked before any request). |
| `NoDataError` | Official.nba.com answered 404, or 403 with S3's `AccessDenied` body. A date without WNBA games is not this (see the Note). |
| `AssetFetchError` | The fetch failed (network error, rate limit, or Akamai WAF block), the 200 body is not a JSON object, or the `wnba` block's `Table`/`Table1` rows are missing or malformed (a row without `game_id` included). With `raw=True` all three leagues (nba, gl and wnba) are checked, since the whole payload is returned. |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.wnba.wnba_officiating import wnba_referee_assignments
result = wnba_referee_assignments("2026-06-13")
officials = result["officials"]
print(f"Found {officials.height} official slots")
```
