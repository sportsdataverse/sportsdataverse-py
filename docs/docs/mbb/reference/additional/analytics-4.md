# Men's college basketball — additional Python functions — Analytics: mbb_team–ncaa_score

### mbb_team_season_rates {#mbb_team_season_rates}

`mbb_team_season_rates(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league: 'str' = 'mens', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

College season team rates from possessions: ORtg/DRtg/net, tempo and the four factors, with splits.

One row per team, season and split (`all`, `home`, `away`, `close`, `clutch`).
Clutch is a possession that starts with 5:00 or less left in the 2nd half (the 4th quarter
in women's basketball from 2016) or an overtime, the score within 5; a close game is one with
a clutch possession. The full definitions are in `sportsdataverse._common.team_season_rates`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2025` is 2024-25). |
| `league` | `str` | `'mens'` | `"mens"` or `"womens"` (`sportsdataverse.wbb.wbb_team_season_rates.wbb_team_season_rates`). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id, split)`. `team_id` is the ESPN team id (Int64). `games`, `poss` / `opp_poss` (offensive / defensive possessions) and `pts` / `opp_pts` are the split's totals. The twelve rates are `off_rtg`, `def_rtg`, `net_rtg` (per 100 possessions), `pace` (possessions per 40 minutes), the four factors `efg_pct`, `tov_pct`, `orb_pct`, `ft_rate` and the same four against (`opp_*`), all fractions. The four factors are game-level (the NCAA team box) and null in the `clutch` split. Each rate has `<m>_rank` (1 = best; `def_rtg`, `tov_pct`, `opp_efg_pct`, `opp_orb_pct` and `opp_ft_rate` rank low first; pace ranks high first), `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile) and `<m>_n` (the sample: possessions for the ratings, the clock in regulation games for pace, field-goal attempts for eFG% and FT rate, the box possessions for turnover rate, rebound chances for ORB%). Ranks are within the season and split, among teams with at least half the most games (which leaves out the non-D1 opponents) whose `<m>_n` reaches the league's `~sportsdataverse._common.rate_gates.TEAM_MIN_N` gate, and null under five teams. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

### mbb_team_strength {#mbb_team_strength}

`mbb_team_strength(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league: 'str' = 'mens', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

College team strength: adjusted ratings, SOS, SOV, tempo and the four factors.

One row per team and season. The adjusted ratings are the published college ratings
(`load_mbb_ratings` / `load_wbb_ratings`). SOS is the mean opponent `adj_net_rtg` over
the team's completed ESPN games (unrated opponents left out), SOV the same over its wins.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2025` is 2024-25). |

| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id)`; `team_id` is the ESPN team id (Int64). `games`, `poss` / `opp_poss`, `pts` / `opp_pts` are the season totals from the NCAA possessions; `wins` / `losses` come from ESPN's completed games. The rated metrics are `adj_off_rtg`, `adj_def_rtg`, `adj_net_rtg`, `sos`, `sov` and the BB-D3 rates (`off_rtg`, `def_rtg`, `net_rtg`, `pace`, the four factors and the four against). Each has `<m>_rank` (1 = best; `adj_def_rtg`, `def_rtg`, `tov_pct` and the opponent shooting, rebounding and free-throw rates rank low first; `sos` ranks the hardest schedule first), `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile) and `<m>_n` (possessions for the ratings, rated games for SOS, the clock in regulation games for pace, wins over rated opponents for SOV). Ranks are within the season, among teams with at least half the most games (which leaves out the non-D1 opponents), the BB-D3 rates' also behind their `~sportsdataverse._common.rate_gates.TEAM_MIN_N` gate, and null under five teams.

strength = mbb_team_strength(2025)
strength.sort("adj_net_rtg_rank").select("team_id", "adj_net_rtg", "sos", "sov").head()
```

### mbb_tournament_ineligible {#mbb_tournament_ineligible}

`mbb_tournament_ineligible(seasons: 'list[int] | None' = None, *, league: 'str | None' = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Division I basketball programs that could not play in the NCAA tournament, per season.

A bundled, hand-curated list (2010-2027): programs reclassifying to Division I (four seasons
from Division II until 2025, three since the NCAA's January 2025 rule; St. Thomas came from
Division III), and APR, NCAA-infractions and self-imposed postseason bans. Every row cites
its source. The college season products (bracketology, season sim, strength of schedule) use
it by default to set `eligible`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `list[int] \| None` | `None` | Seasons to keep, as the end year (`2024` is 2023-24). `None` keeps all. |
| `league` | `str \| None` | `None` | `"mens"`, `"womens"`, or `None` for both. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas DataFrame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per ineligible `(season, league, team_id)`: `season, league, team_id` (ESPN team id, Utf8), `team`, `reason` (`reclassifying`, `apr_ban`, `infractions_ban`, `self_imposed_ban` or `other`), `detail`, `source_url` and `confidence` (`high` / `medium`).

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `season` | Int64 | Season, as the end year (2024 is 2023-24). |
| `league` | String | mens or womens. |
| `team_id` | String | ESPN team id (Utf8). |
| `team` | String | School name of the barred program, as the source spells it; join on team_id. |
| `reason` | String | Why the program was barred: reclassifying, apr_ban, infractions_ban, self_imposed_ban or other. |
| `detail` | String | Short note on the row, such as the reclassification year or the case behind the ban. |
| `source_url` | String | The source that documents the row. |
| `confidence` | String | How well the source documents the row: high (the NCAA, the school or the conference says so) or medium (a secondary source). |

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If `league` is not `"mens"`, `"womens"` or `None`. |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb import mbb_tournament_ineligible
barred = mbb_tournament_ineligible([2023], league="mens")

# Pipeline next step (one line)

barred.filter(pl.col("reason") == "reclassifying").get_column("team").to_list()
```

### ncaa_coach_stints {#ncaa_coach_stints}

`ncaa_coach_stints(coaches: 'pl.DataFrame', records: 'pl.DataFrame') -> 'pl.DataFrame'`

The card coach of each team-season as a whole-season stint, unless the card says the season changed hands.

A card whose season record (`coach_season_records`) is short of the team's by more than
a game and more than a loss marks a mid-season change, and its figures are not the card
coach's own games: on Sports-Reference they are the other coach's (Ole Miss 2017-18's card
names Andy Kennedy with 1-4, Tony Madlock's five games; Kennedy went 11-16). Such a team-season
gets no stint, so it stays uncredited (and is counted in a log line). Otherwise -- the record
matches, is a loss off, drops vacated wins (never losses), or cannot be computed -- the card
coach has the whole season.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coaches` | `DataFrame` |  | `ncaa_team_coaches` rows, with the season before each wanted one for the record difference. |
| `records` | `DataFrame` |  | The teams' season records: `season`, `team_id`, `games`, `losses` (as `sportsdataverse._common.team_luck.season_records` gives them). |

**Returns**

Stints in `~sportsdataverse._common.coach_seasons.STINTS_SCHEMA` with no counts and `position="any"`, one per team-season with a card, an ESPN team id (cards with none are counted in a log line) and no mid-season change.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `season` | Int64 | Season, named by the year it ends (2025 is 2024-25). |
| `team_id` | Int64 | ESPN team id of the school (from the card's NCAA team-season crosswalk). |
| `coach_id` | Int64 | NCAA person id of the card's head coach (stats.ncaa.org /people/{id}). |
| `coach` | String | Head coach's name on the card. |
| `games` | Int64 | Always null here; the card coach has the whole season (a season the card shows changing hands has no stint). |
| `wins` | Int64 | Always null here, as games. |
| `position` | String | Always any; one whole-season stint per team-season. |

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If two cards name a coach for the same (season, team_id). |

### ncaa_impact_rows {#ncaa_impact_rows}

`ncaa_impact_rows(pbp: 'pl.DataFrame', possessions: 'pl.DataFrame', *, league: 'str' = 'mens') -> 'pl.DataFrame'`

Map the stats.ncaa.org pbp and possessions onto the game-impact row frame.

One row per event (the clock since the previous event in the period and the points scored on
it, on that event's lineup; a free throw on the lineup at the last foul) and one per
possession (its lineup and which side had it, `poss_team == home`). The clock left in a
period after its last event goes to that event's lineup, so each period's clock is whole. The
possessions of a contest with no pbp events, and those whose `poss_team` is neither side,
are dropped.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pbp` | `DataFrame` |  | `load_ncaa_mbb_pbp` / `load_ncaa_wbb_pbp` rows, in release (game) order, with the cumulative `game_seconds` and the `period`. |
| `possessions` | `DataFrame` |  | `load_ncaa_mbb_possessions` / `load_ncaa_wbb_possessions` rows. |
| `league` | `str` | `'mens'` | `"mens"` (20-minute halves) or `"womens"` (10-minute quarters from 2016, halves before); overtimes are 5 minutes. |

**Returns**

Rows in `sportsdataverse._common.game_impact.impact_row_schema` with String player ids.

| `away_5` | String | Away player 5 on the floor (on a free throw, the player on the floor at the last foul). |
| `seconds` | Float64 | Game clock that ran into this action (0 on a possession row). |
| `home_pts` | Int64 | Points the home team scored on this action (0 on a possession row). |
| `away_pts` | Int64 | Points the away team scored on this action (0 on a possession row). |
| `home_poss` | Int64 | 1 on a possession row where the home team has the ball, else 0. |
| `away_poss` | Int64 | 1 on a possession row where the away team has the ball, else 0. |

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If `league` is not `"mens"` or `"womens"`. |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_loaders import load_ncaa_mbb_pbp, load_ncaa_mbb_possessions
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_game_impact import ncaa_impact_rows
rows = ncaa_impact_rows(load_ncaa_mbb_pbp(2025), load_ncaa_mbb_possessions(2025))
```

### ncaa_lineup_count_rows {#ncaa_lineup_count_rows}

`ncaa_lineup_count_rows(pbp: 'pl.DataFrame') -> 'pl.DataFrame'`

Map the stats.ncaa.org pbp onto the lineup-seasons count frame.

Each shot, free throw, rebound and turnover counts for the side whose `event_team` it is,
on the lineup at the event; a free throw on the lineup at the most recent foul
(`sportsdataverse._common.game_impact.credit_free_throws_to_foul_lineup`). Events with
no count are dropped.

**Parameters**

### ncaa_mbb_lineups {#ncaa_mbb_lineups}

`ncaa_mbb_lineups(pbp: 'pl.DataFrame', *, include_transition: 'bool' = False, fix_tip_in: 'bool' = True, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'`

Aggregate bigballR-contract play-by-play into per-lineup stats.

Port of bigballR `get_lineups` (`all_functions.R:1945-2521`). Rows
with any missing on-court player and substitution rows are dropped, each
row's home/away five are byte-sorted so a lineup always occupies the same
columns, and the home + away passes are combined per `(p1..p5, team)`.
Ratios are derived from the summed counters, rounded to 3 decimals, and
NA/Inf are zeroed exactly where R does it.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pbp` | `DataFrame` |  | Play-by-play frame in the sdv-py 35-column snake_case bigballR contract (`parse_ncaa_bb_game_pbp` output). May span multiple games. |
| `include_transition` | `bool` | `False` | When True, append the `_trans`/`_half` split surface plus `o_trans_pct`/`d_trans_pct` (213 columns total). |
| `fix_tip_in` | `bool` | `True` | When True (default), rim stats count the scrape engine's real `"Tip In"` vocabulary. When False, reproduce R's literal `"Tip-In"` test (`all_functions.R:2012`) — tip-ins silently excluded — for oracle parity. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of polars. |

**Returns**

`pl.DataFrame` (or `pd.DataFrame`) with one row per lineup+team — 75 columns (`LINEUPS_COLUMNS`) or 213 with `include_transition=True` (`LINEUPS_TRANSITION_COLUMNS`), rows sorted by `p1..p5, team`. Empty input yields an empty frame with the documented schema.

### ncaa_mbb_on_off {#ncaa_mbb_on_off}

`ncaa_mbb_on_off(players: 'Union[str, Sequence[str]]', lineups: 'pl.DataFrame', *, included: 'Union[str, Sequence[str], None]' = None, excluded: 'Union[str, Sequence[str], None]' = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'`

Team stats for every on/off combination of the given players.

Port of bigballR `on_off_generator` (`all_functions.R:2555-2749`,
`include_transition=F` path). For k players, all `2^k` on/off
assignments are enumerated in R's `expand.grid` order (first player
varies fastest; first row all-On, last all-Off); each combination sums
the lineups whose membership matches exactly, re-derives the full ratio
block (including `e_poss`), rounds to 3 decimals, and zeroes NA/Inf.
Combinations matching zero lineups produce an all-zero row.

Faithful R quirk (kept, flagged): when `included`/`excluded` is
passed, the base lineup set comes from the membership filter ONLY — the
inferred-team filter is skipped (`all_functions.R:2584-2589`), so an
included player on another team would leak that team's lineups in.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `players` | `Union[str, Sequence[str]]` |  | Player name(s) to split on (the `Status` axis). |
| `lineups` | `DataFrame` |  | Lineups frame from `ncaa_mbb_lineups`. |
| `included` | `Union[str, Sequence[str], None]` | `None` | Optional membership filter forwarded to `ncaa_mbb_player_lineups` (replaces the team filter). |
| `excluded` | `Union[str, Sequence[str], None]` | `None` | Optional membership filter forwarded to `ncaa_mbb_player_lineups` (replaces the team filter). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of polars. |

**Returns**

`pl.DataFrame` (or `pd.DataFrame`) with `2^k` rows — `status` (e.g. `"A.PLAYER On | B.PLAYER Off"`) + the 69 stat columns (`ON_OFF_COLUMNS`).

**Example**

split = ncaa_mbb_on_off("KEATON.WAGLER", lineups)
print(split.shape)

# Pipeline next step (one line)

split.select("status", "netrtg")
```

### ncaa_mbb_player_combos {#ncaa_mbb_player_combos}

`ncaa_mbb_player_combos(lineups: 'pl.DataFrame', *, n: 'int' = 2, min_mins: 'float' = 0, included: 'Union[str, Sequence[str], None]' = None, excluded: 'Union[str, Sequence[str], None]' = None, include_transition: 'bool' = False, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'`

Team stats for every n-player combination on the court together.

Port of bigballR `get_player_combos` + `team_comb`
(`get_player_combos.R:19-38` + `:42-191`). Combos are enumerated per
team over the byte-sorted unique player pool (lexicographic
`gtools::combinations` order), filtered to combos whose lineups total
strictly more than `min_mins` minutes, then each combo's lineup rows
are summed and the ratio block re-derived. **Rounding is 2 decimals**
here (R rounds 3 in `get_lineups` / `on_off_generator`) and `e_poss`
is the SUM of the per-lineup estimates, not a recompute — both faithful.

R's `include_transition` switch is dead code (an exact-match guard at
`get_player_combos.R:28-30` always forces it back to `FALSE`); the
port implements the suffix-match intent but keeps the `False` default,
which is the only R-reachable behavior.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lineups` | `DataFrame` |  | Lineups frame from `ncaa_mbb_lineups`. |
| `n` | `int` | `2` | Combination size, 1-5. |
| `min_mins` | `float` | `0` | Keep combos with total on-court minutes strictly greater than this (summed over the rounded per-lineup `mins`). |
| `included` | `Union[str, Sequence[str], None]` | `None` | Player name(s) that must be on the court in every lineup considered. |
| `excluded` | `Union[str, Sequence[str], None]` | `None` | Player name(s) that must be off the court in every lineup considered. |
| `include_transition` | `bool` | `False` | Re-derive the `_trans`/`_half` ratio surface (requires a transition lineups frame; forced `False` otherwise). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of polars. |

**Returns**

`pl.DataFrame` (or `pd.DataFrame`) with one row per combo: `team, p1..pn` + the stat surface of the input frame. Teams appear in byte-sorted order.

Filter a lineups frame by on-court player membership.

Port of bigballR `get_player_lineups` (`all_functions.R:2761-2792`):
keep rows where every `included` player is on the court (in `p1..p5`)
and no `excluded` player is. With both filters `None` the input is
returned unchanged (R's `Included = NA, Excluded = NA` passthrough).
Membership is tested by name against `p1..p5` (R tests the positional
first five columns); row order is preserved.

**Parameters**
