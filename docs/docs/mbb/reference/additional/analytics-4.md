### mbb_strength_of_schedule {#mbb_strength_of_schedule}

`mbb_strength_of_schedule(seasons: 'list[int]', *, as_of_date: 'datetime.date | None' = None, league: 'str' = 'mens', ineligible: 'Iterable[str] | None' = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

The daily `strength_of_schedule` table: records, SoS, quad résumé, WAB, RPI and a NET estimate.

Loads the released ESPN schedule and team box per season and builds
`~sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_college_season.season_resume` from the games strictly
before `as_of_date`: opponent-adjusted ratings, SoS (mean opponent AdjEM), WAB, the
NCAA Quad 1-4 record (opponents ranked by the NET estimate), the NCAA RPI
(25% WP / 50% OWP / 25% OOWP, location-weighted WP) and the NET-style estimate
(`0.8 * z(AdjEM) + 0.2 * z(WAB)`). Division I teams only; RPI, SoS, WAB and the quads
count Division I games only.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `list[int]` |  | Seasons to compute (e.g. `[2024]`). |
| `as_of_date` | `date \| None` | `None` | Only use games strictly before this date; `None` uses every completed game. Applies to every season in `seasons`. |
| `league` | `str` | `'mens'` | `"mens"` or `"womens"`. |

| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas DataFrame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per Division I (season, team_id), best `net_estimate_rank` first. The `_rank` / `_pct` columns (1 is best, average ties, within the season) and `_n` (the Division I games behind each number; all games for `adj_em`) follow BB-D2's league-context grammar.

### mbb_team_luck {#mbb_team_luck}

`mbb_team_luck(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league: 'str' = 'mens', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

College luck and close-game record: Pythagorean expected wins vs actual wins, and close-game W-L.

One row per team and season. `exp_wins` is the Pythagorean expectation on the season's
final scores, `games * pts^x / (pts^x + opp_pts^x)`, with the exponent `x` fitted per
league on past seasons (`~sportsdataverse._common.team_luck.PYTHAG_EXPONENT`).
`luck_wins` is `wins - exp_wins`. A close game is one within 5 points at the start of a
possession in play in the last 5:00 of the 2nd half (4th quarter, women's, from 2016) or
overtime: one that starts there, or starts before 5:00 and ends after it.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2025` is 2024-25). |
| `league` | `str` | `'mens'` | `"mens"` or `"womens"` (`sportsdataverse.wbb.wbb_team_luck.wbb_team_luck`). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id)`; `team_id` is the ESPN team id (Int64). `games`, `wins`, `losses`, `pts` and `opp_pts` are from ESPN's completed games (postseason included); `win_pct`, `pythag_win_pct`, `exp_wins` and `luck_wins` (`wins - exp_wins`) follow. `pbp_games` counts the games with published NCAA possessions, and `close_games`, `close_wins`, `close_losses` and `close_win_pct` (null with no close game) are the close games among them. `pythag_win_pct`, `luck_wins` and `close_win_pct` have `<m>_rank` (1 = highest), `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile) and `<m>_n` (games, or close games); ranks are within the season, among teams with at least half the most games (which leaves out the non-D1 opponents; `close_win_pct` also needs possessions for half of them and five close games), and null under five teams. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `season` | Int64 | Season, named by the year it ends (2025 is 2024-25). |
| `team_id` | Int64 | ESPN team id. Non-D1 opponents get rows of their own (a game or two) and no ranks. |
| `games` | Int64 | Games in the season's completed ESPN games, postseason included. |
| `wins` | Int64 | Wins in the season's completed ESPN games, postseason included. |
| `losses` | Int64 | Losses in the season's completed ESPN games, postseason included. |
| `pts` | Int64 | Points scored in those games (final scores). |
| `opp_pts` | Int64 | Points allowed in those games (final scores). |

| `exp_wins` | Float64 | Expected wins: pythag_win_pct * games. |
| `luck_wins` | Float64 | Luck in wins: wins minus exp_wins. Positive means the team won more games than its scoring says it should have. |
| `pbp_games` | Int64 | Games with published possessions (ncaa_mbb_possessions); close_games is counted among these. A game whose late possessions are missing from the release counts as not close. |
| `close_games` | Int64 | Close games: at least one possession in play with 5:00 or less left (starting there, or starting before 5:00 and ending after it) in the 2nd half (the 4th quarter for league='womens' from 2016) or an overtime, the score within 5 as that possession starts (stats.nba.com's clutch window; BB-D3's close split). The margin is the running sum of the possessions' points, so it can drift from the scoreboard: NBA 2025-26 agrees with an independent ESPN play-by-play recount on 1215 of 1229 games. |
| `close_wins` | Int64 | Wins in close games. |
| `close_losses` | Int64 | Losses in close games. |

| `luck_wins_rank` | Float64 | Rank of luck_wins within the season (the highest value ranks 1; ties average), among teams that played at least half the most games any team played in the season; null for a non-qualifier, a null value, or fewer than five qualifiers, or when every qualifier has the same value. |
| `close_win_pct_rank` | Float64 | Rank of close_win_pct within the season (the highest value ranks 1; ties average), among teams that played at least half the most games any team played in the season, have possessions for at least half their games and played at least five close games (MIN_CLOSE_GAMES); null otherwise, for a null value, or with fewer than five qualifiers, or when every qualifier has the same value. |
| `pythag_win_pct_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of pythag_win_pct within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |
| `luck_wins_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of luck_wins within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |
| `close_win_pct_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of close_win_pct within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |
| `pythag_win_pct_n` | Int64 | Sample size of pythag_win_pct: games. |
| `luck_wins_n` | Int64 | Sample size of luck_wins: games. |
| `close_win_pct_n` | Int64 | Sample size of close_win_pct: close games. |

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If `league` is not `"mens"` or `"womens"`. |
| `SeasonNotFoundError` | For a season before 2010, the first with NCAA possessions. |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_team_luck import mbb_team_luck
luck = mbb_team_luck(2025)
luck.sort("luck_wins", descending=True).select("team_id", "wins", "exp_wins", "luck_wins").head()
```

### mbb_team_season_rates {#mbb_team_season_rates}

`mbb_team_season_rates(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league: 'str' = 'mens', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

College season team rates from possessions: ORtg/DRtg/net, tempo and the four factors, with splits.

One row per team, season and split (`all`, `home`, `away`, `close`, `clutch`).
Clutch is a possession in play with 5:00 or less left (starting there, or the one live at the
5:00 mark: it starts before 5:00 and ends after it; one that ends exactly at 5:00 is out) in
the 2nd half (the 4th quarter in women's basketball from 2016) or an overtime, the score
within 5 as it starts; a close game is one with a clutch possession. The full definitions
are in `sportsdataverse._common.team_season_rates`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2025` is 2024-25). |
| `league` | `str` | `'mens'` | `"mens"` or `"womens"` (`sportsdataverse.wbb.wbb_team_season_rates.wbb_team_season_rates`). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id, split)`. `team_id` is the ESPN team id (Int64). `games`, `poss` / `opp_poss` (offensive / defensive possessions) and `pts` / `opp_pts` are the split's totals. The twelve rates are `off_rtg`, `def_rtg`, `net_rtg` (per 100 possessions), `pace` (possessions per 40 minutes), the four factors `efg_pct`, `tov_pct`, `orb_pct`, `ft_rate` and the same four against (`opp_*`), all fractions. The four factors are game-level (the NCAA team box) and null in the `clutch` split. Each rate has `<m>_rank` (1 = best; `def_rtg`, `tov_pct`, `opp_efg_pct`, `opp_orb_pct` and `opp_ft_rate` rank low first; pace ranks high first), `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile) and `<m>_n` (the sample: possessions for the ratings, the clock in regulation games for pace, field-goal attempts for eFG% and FT rate, the box possessions for turnover rate, rebound chances for ORB%). Ranks are within the season and split, among teams with at least half the most games (which leaves out the non-D1 opponents) whose `<m>_n` reaches the league's `~sportsdataverse._common.rate_gates.TEAM_MIN_N` gate, and null under five teams.
