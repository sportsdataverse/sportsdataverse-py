# Men's college basketball — additional Python functions — Analytics: mbb_team–strength_of

### mbb_team_luck {#mbb_team_luck}

`mbb_team_luck(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league: 'str' = 'mens', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

College luck and close-game record: Pythagorean expected wins vs actual wins, and close-game W-L.

One row per team and season. `exp_wins` is the Pythagorean expectation on the season's
final scores, `games * pts^x / (pts^x + opp_pts^x)`, with the exponent `x` fitted per
league on past seasons (`~sportsdataverse._common.team_luck.PYTHAG_EXPONENT`).
`luck_wins` is `wins - exp_wins`. A close game is one within 5 points at the start of a
possession in the last 5:00 of the 2nd half (4th quarter, women's, from 2016) or overtime.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2025` is 2024-25). |
| `league` | `str` | `'mens'` | `"mens"` or `"womens"` (`sportsdataverse.wbb.wbb_team_luck.wbb_team_luck`). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id)`; `team_id` is the ESPN team id (Int64). `games`, `wins`, `losses`, `pts` and `opp_pts` are from ESPN's completed games (postseason included); `win_pct`, `pythag_win_pct`, `exp_wins` and `luck_wins` (`wins - exp_wins`) follow. `pbp_games` counts the games with published NCAA possessions, and `close_games`, `close_wins`, `close_losses` and `close_win_pct` (null with no close game) are the close games among them. `pythag_win_pct`, `luck_wins` and `close_win_pct` have `<m>_rank` (1 = highest), `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile) and `<m>_n` (games, or close games); ranks are within the season, among teams with at least half the most games (which leaves out the non-D1 opponents; `close_win_pct` also needs possessions for half of them and five close games), and null under five teams. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `season` | Int64 | Season, named by the year it ends (2025 is 2024-25). |
| `team_id` | Int64 | ESPN team id. Non-D1 opponents get rows of their own (a game or two) and no ranks. |
| `games` | Int64 | Games in the season's completed ESPN games, postseason included. |
| `wins` | Int64 | Wins in the season's completed ESPN games, postseason included. |
| `losses` | Int64 | Losses in the season's completed ESPN games, postseason included. |

| `close_games` | Int64 | Close games: at least one possession started with 5:00 or less left in the 2nd half or an overtime, the score within 5 (stats.nba.com's clutch window; BB-D3's close split). The margin is the running sum of the possessions' points, so it can drift from the scoreboard: NBA 2025-26 agrees with an independent ESPN play-by-play recount on 1210 of 1229 games. |
| `close_wins` | Int64 | Wins in close games. |
| `close_losses` | Int64 | Losses in close games. |

| `luck_wins_rank` | Float64 | Rank of luck_wins within the season (the highest value ranks 1; ties average), among teams that played at least half the most games any team played in the season; null for a non-qualifier, a null value, or fewer than five qualifiers, or when every qualifier has the same value. |
| `close_win_pct_rank` | Float64 | Rank of close_win_pct within the season (the highest value ranks 1; ties average), among teams that played at least half the most games any team played in the season, have possessions for at least half their games and played at least five close games (MIN_CLOSE_GAMES); null otherwise, for a null value, or with fewer than five qualifiers, or when every qualifier has the same value. |
| `pythag_win_pct_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of pythag_win_pct within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |
| `luck_wins_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of luck_wins within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |
| `close_win_pct_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of close_win_pct within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |
| `pythag_win_pct_n` | Int64 | Sample size of pythag_win_pct: games. |
| `luck_wins_n` | Int64 | Sample size of luck_wins: games. |

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If `league` is not `"mens"` or `"womens"`. |
| `SeasonNotFoundError` | For a season before 2010, the first with NCAA possessions. |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_team_luck import mbb_team_luck
luck = mbb_team_luck(2025)
luck.sort("luck_wins", descending=True).select("team_id", "wins", "exp_wins", "luck_wins").head()
```

### mbb_team_season_rates {#mbb_team_season_rates}

`mbb_team_season_rates(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league: 'str' = 'mens', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

College season team rates from possessions: ORtg/DRtg/net, tempo and the four factors, with splits.

One row per team, season and split (`all`, `home`, `away`, `close`, `clutch`).
Clutch is a possession that starts with 5:00 or less left in the 2nd half (the 4th quarter
in women's basketball from 2016) or an overtime, the score within 5; a close game is one with
a clutch possession. The full definitions are in `sportsdataverse._common.team_season_rates`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

| `league` | `str` | `'mens'` | `"mens"` or `"womens"` (`sportsdataverse.wbb.wbb_team_season_rates.wbb_team_season_rates`). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id, split)`. `team_id` is the ESPN team id (Int64). `games`, `poss` / `opp_poss` (offensive / defensive possessions) and `pts` / `opp_pts` are the split's totals. The twelve rates are `off_rtg`, `def_rtg`, `net_rtg` (per 100 possessions), `pace` (possessions per 40 minutes), the four factors `efg_pct`, `tov_pct`, `orb_pct`, `ft_rate` and the same four against (`opp_*`), all fractions. The four factors are game-level (the NCAA team box) and null in the `clutch` split. Each rate has `<m>_rank` (1 = best; `def_rtg`, `tov_pct`, `opp_efg_pct`, `opp_orb_pct` and `opp_ft_rate` rank low first; pace ranks high first), `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile) and `<m>_n` (the sample: possessions for the ratings, games for pace, field-goal attempts for eFG% and FT rate, the box possessions for turnover rate, rebound chances for ORB%). Ranks are within the season and split, among teams with at least half the most games (which leaves out the non-D1 opponents), and null under five teams.

### ncaa_impact_rows {#ncaa_impact_rows}

`ncaa_impact_rows(pbp: 'pl.DataFrame', possessions: 'pl.DataFrame', *, league: 'str' = 'mens') -> 'pl.DataFrame'`

Map the stats.ncaa.org pbp and possessions onto the game-impact row frame.

One row per event (the clock since the previous event in the period and the points scored on
it, on that event's lineup; a free throw on the lineup at the last foul) and one per
possession (its lineup and which side had it, `poss_team == home`). The clock left in a
period after its last event goes to that event's lineup, so each period's clock is whole. The
possessions of a contest with no pbp events, and those whose `poss_team` is neither side,
are dropped.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pbp` | `DataFrame` |  | `load_ncaa_mbb_pbp` / `load_ncaa_wbb_pbp` rows, in release (game) order, with the cumulative `game_seconds` and the `period`. |
| `possessions` | `DataFrame` |  | `load_ncaa_mbb_possessions` / `load_ncaa_wbb_possessions` rows. |
| `league` | `str` | `'mens'` | `"mens"` (20-minute halves) or `"womens"` (10-minute quarters from 2016, halves before); overtimes are 5 minutes. |

**Returns**

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If `league` is not `"mens"` or `"womens"`. |

**Example**

from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_loaders import load_ncaa_mbb_pbp, load_ncaa_mbb_possessions
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_game_impact import ncaa_impact_rows

### ncaa_mbb_lineups {#ncaa_mbb_lineups}

`ncaa_mbb_lineups(pbp: 'pl.DataFrame', *, include_transition: 'bool' = False, fix_tip_in: 'bool' = True, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'`

Aggregate bigballR-contract play-by-play into per-lineup stats.

Port of bigballR `get_lineups` (`all_functions.R:1945-2521`). Rows
with any missing on-court player and substitution rows are dropped, each
row's home/away five are byte-sorted so a lineup always occupies the same
columns, and the home + away passes are combined per `(p1..p5, team)`.
Ratios are derived from the summed counters, rounded to 3 decimals, and
NA/Inf are zeroed exactly where R does it.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pbp` | `DataFrame` |  | Play-by-play frame in the sdv-py 35-column snake_case bigballR contract (`parse_ncaa_bb_game_pbp` output). May span multiple games. |
| `include_transition` | `bool` | `False` | When True, append the `_trans`/`_half` split surface plus `o_trans_pct`/`d_trans_pct` (213 columns total). |
| `fix_tip_in` | `bool` | `True` | When True (default), rim stats count the scrape engine's real `"Tip In"` vocabulary. When False, reproduce R's literal `"Tip-In"` test (`all_functions.R:2012`) — tip-ins silently excluded — for oracle parity. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of polars. |

**Returns**

`pl.DataFrame` (or `pd.DataFrame`) with one row per lineup+team — 75 columns (`LINEUPS_COLUMNS`) or 213 with `include_transition=True` (`LINEUPS_TRANSITION_COLUMNS`), rows sorted by `p1..p5, team`. Empty input yields an empty frame with the documented schema.

### ncaa_mbb_on_off {#ncaa_mbb_on_off}

`ncaa_mbb_on_off(players: 'Union[str, Sequence[str]]', lineups: 'pl.DataFrame', *, included: 'Union[str, Sequence[str], None]' = None, excluded: 'Union[str, Sequence[str], None]' = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'`

Team stats for every on/off combination of the given players.

Port of bigballR `on_off_generator` (`all_functions.R:2555-2749`,
`include_transition=F` path). For k players, all `2^k` on/off
assignments are enumerated in R's `expand.grid` order (first player
varies fastest; first row all-On, last all-Off); each combination sums
the lineups whose membership matches exactly, re-derives the full ratio
block (including `e_poss`), rounds to 3 decimals, and zeroes NA/Inf.
Combinations matching zero lineups produce an all-zero row.

Faithful R quirk (kept, flagged): when `included`/`excluded` is
passed, the base lineup set comes from the membership filter ONLY — the
inferred-team filter is skipped (`all_functions.R:2584-2589`), so an
included player on another team would leak that team's lineups in.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `players` | `Union[str, Sequence[str]]` |  | Player name(s) to split on (the `Status` axis). |
| `lineups` | `DataFrame` |  | Lineups frame from `ncaa_mbb_lineups`. |
| `included` | `Union[str, Sequence[str], None]` | `None` | Optional membership filter forwarded to `ncaa_mbb_player_lineups` (replaces the team filter). |
| `excluded` | `Union[str, Sequence[str], None]` | `None` | Optional membership filter forwarded to `ncaa_mbb_player_lineups` (replaces the team filter). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of polars. |

**Returns**

`pl.DataFrame` (or `pd.DataFrame`) with `2^k` rows — `status` (e.g. `"A.PLAYER On | B.PLAYER Off"`) + the 69 stat columns (`ON_OFF_COLUMNS`).

`ncaa_mbb_player_combos(lineups: 'pl.DataFrame', *, n: 'int' = 2, min_mins: 'float' = 0, included: 'Union[str, Sequence[str], None]' = None, excluded: 'Union[str, Sequence[str], None]' = None, include_transition: 'bool' = False, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'`

Team stats for every n-player combination on the court together.

Port of bigballR `get_player_combos` + `team_comb`
(`get_player_combos.R:19-38` + `:42-191`). Combos are enumerated per
team over the byte-sorted unique player pool (lexicographic
`gtools::combinations` order), filtered to combos whose lineups total
strictly more than `min_mins` minutes, then each combo's lineup rows
are summed and the ratio block re-derived. **Rounding is 2 decimals**
here (R rounds 3 in `get_lineups` / `on_off_generator`) and `e_poss`
is the SUM of the per-lineup estimates, not a recompute — both faithful.

R's `include_transition` switch is dead code (an exact-match guard at
`get_player_combos.R:28-30` always forces it back to `FALSE`); the
port implements the suffix-match intent but keeps the `False` default,
which is the only R-reachable behavior.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lineups` | `DataFrame` |  | Lineups frame from `ncaa_mbb_lineups`. |
| `n` | `int` | `2` | Combination size, 1-5. |
| `min_mins` | `float` | `0` | Keep combos with total on-court minutes strictly greater than this (summed over the rounded per-lineup `mins`). |
| `included` | `Union[str, Sequence[str], None]` | `None` | Player name(s) that must be on the court in every lineup considered. |
| `excluded` | `Union[str, Sequence[str], None]` | `None` | Player name(s) that must be off the court in every lineup considered. |
| `include_transition` | `bool` | `False` | Re-derive the `_trans`/`_half` ratio surface (requires a transition lineups frame; forced `False` otherwise). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of polars. |

**Returns**

`pl.DataFrame` (or `pd.DataFrame`) with one row per combo: `team, p1..pn` + the stat surface of the input frame. Teams appear in byte-sorted order.

Filter a lineups frame by on-court player membership.

Port of bigballR `get_player_lineups` (`all_functions.R:2761-2792`):
keep rows where every `included` player is on the court (in `p1..p5`)
and no `excluded` player is. With both filters `None` the input is
returned unchanged (R's `Included = NA, Excluded = NA` passthrough).
Membership is tested by name against `p1..p5` (R tests the positional
first five columns); row order is preserved.

**Parameters**

```

### ncaa_team_box_count_rows {#ncaa_team_box_count_rows}

`ncaa_team_box_count_rows(team_box: 'pl.DataFrame') -> 'pl.DataFrame'`

Map `ncaa_{mbb,wbb}_team_box` rows onto the four-factor count frame.

Each row is one team's offense in one game: its FGA, FGM, 3PM, FTA, offensive rebounds and

### order_lineup {#order_lineup}

`order_lineup(player_codes_and_ids: 'list[dict[str, str]]', players_by_id: 'dict[str, dict[str, Any]]', team_season: 'str') -> 'list[dict[str, str]]'`

Order a 5-man lineup `X1_X2_X3_X4_X5` into PG/SG/SF/PF/C slot order.

Faithful port of `PositionUtils.orderLineup` (`PositionUtils.ts:696-761`).
Greedily fits each player (in input order) to their best-scoring slot via
`_fit_player` (dominated by `pos_class_to_score` on the
player's `posClass`, tie-broken by their raw `posConfidences`),
evicting and recursively re-fitting any player displaced along the way,
then applies `apply_relative_positional_overrides` (keyed on
`team_season`) as a final hand-tuned correction pass.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `player_codes_and_ids` | `list[dict[str, str]]` |  | The lineup membership, each a `{"code": ..., "id": ...}` dict. Order does not affect the final result (the slot-fitting algorithm is order-invariant by construction -- displaced players are always re-fit). |
| `players_by_id` | `dict[str, dict[str, Any]]` |  | Per-player positional info keyed by `id`, each a `{"posConfidences": [pg, sg, sf, pf, c], "posClass": "..."}` dict (the tradPosList-ordered raw confidence scores plus the classifier's `ID_TO_POSITION`-keyed class label). |
| `team_season` | `str` |  | Key into `RELATIVE_POSITION_FIXES` for the final override pass. |

**Returns**

A 5-element list of `{"code": ..., "id": ...}` dicts in PG/SG/SF/PF/C order.

**Example**

```python
::

from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_positions import order_lineup
players_by_id = {
    "Cowan, Anthony": {"posConfidences": [60, 40, 10, 0, 0], "posClass": "s-PG"},
    "Ayala, Eric": {"posConfidences": [40, 60, 10, 0, 0], "posClass": "CG"},
}
order_lineup(
    [{"code": "AnCowan", "id": "Cowan, Anthony"},
     {"code": "ErAyala", "id": "Ayala, Eric"}],
    players_by_id, "",
)
```

### pos_class_to_score {#pos_class_to_score}

`pos_class_to_score(pos_class: 'str') -> 'int'`

Ordinal "positional weight" for a position class, PG=1000..C=8000.

Faithful port of `PositionUtils.posClassToScore` (`PositionUtils.ts:629-654`,
a literal `switch`). Unmapped classes default to `4000` (the TS
default-case comment notes "won't happen").

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pos_class` | `str` |  | A position-class code (e.g. `"PG"`, `"WF"`, `"C"`). |

**Returns**

The class's ordinal score.

**Example**

```python
::

from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_positions import pos_class_to_score
pos_class_to_score("WF")
```

### project_bracket {#project_bracket}

`project_bracket(resume: 'pl.DataFrame', auto_bids: 'set[str]', *, league: 'str' = 'mens', field_size: 'int' = 68) -> 'pl.DataFrame'`

Select and seed a tournament field from a per-team résumé frame.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `resume` | `DataFrame` |  | One row per (season, team_id) with `adj_em_z, sos, wab, quad1_w` (the ratings + strength-of-schedule outputs joined). |
| `auto_bids` | `set[str]` |  | `team_id` set of conference auto-bid teams (see `~sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_college_season.conference_auto_bids`); always in the field. |
| `league` | `str` | `'mens'` | `"mens"` or `"womens"` (kept for shim parity; the blend is league-agnostic). |
| `field_size` | `int` | `68` | Tournament field size (68). |

**Returns**

One row per input team: `season, team_id, resume_score, projected_seed` (1-16, null outside the field; in a 68-team field the last four at-large teams and the four worst auto-bids share First Four slots, so every line has four slots), `at_large_prob` (logistic in `resume_score` centred on the selection cutoff -- every selected at-large clears 0.5), `auto_bid`, `at_large_rank` (1 = the best résumé without an auto-bid; null for auto-bids), `bid` (exactly `field_size` true).

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it needs a resume frame (strength of schedule joined with the ratings' adj_em_z) that no package function returns.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_bracketology import project_bracket
field = project_bracket(resume, auto_bids)
```

### regress_shot_quality {#regress_shot_quality}

`regress_shot_quality(stat: 'float', pos: 'int', feat: 'str', player: 'dict[str, Any]') -> 'float'`

Shrink a small-sample shot-quality stat toward its positional average.

Faithful port of `PositionUtils.regressShotQuality`
(`PositionUtils.ts:216-258`). Only the three relative shot-quality
features (`calc_three_relative` / `calc_rim_relative` /
`calc_mid_relative`) are regressed; any other `feat` passes `stat`
through unchanged. A player is regressed toward the positional average
whenever the relevant shot volume is below `max(0.25 * total_fga, 15)`
(i.e. under 25% of their attempts come from that zone, floored at 15
attempts). A `center` (`pos == 4`) who took 0-2 threes and made none is
left at `0` to avoid widespread changes.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stat` | `float` |  | The raw (unregressed) feature value. |
| `pos` | `int` |  | Position index (`0=pg` ... `4=c`). |
| `feat` | `str` |  | Feature field name (only the three relative shot-quality keys trigger regression; anything else is a passthrough). |
| `player` | `dict[str, Any]` |  | The player stat dict; reads `total_off_fga` and the per-feature volume field (`total_off_{3p,2pmid,2prim}_attempts`), each shaped `{"value": N}`. |

**Returns**

The regressed feature value (or `stat` unchanged when the feature is not regressed, volume is sufficient, or the center-3s carve-out fires).

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `KeyError` | If `player` lacks `total_off_fga` (faithful to the TS, which throws on the same missing field). |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_positions import regress_shot_quality
player = {"total_off_fga": {"value": 25},
          "total_off_3p_attempts": {"value": 1}}
regress_shot_quality(-15.5, 2, "misc_feature", player)

# Low-volume shrink toward the positional average

regress_shot_quality(100, 3, "calc_rim_relative",
    {"total_off_fga": {"value": 25},
     "total_off_2prim_attempts": {"value": 8}})
```

### strength_of_schedule {#strength_of_schedule}

`strength_of_schedule(results: 'pl.DataFrame', ratings: 'pl.DataFrame', *, league: 'str' = 'mens') -> 'pl.DataFrame'`

Per-team SoS + Quad 1-4 record + WAB from completed games and ratings.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `results` | `DataFrame` |  | Completed games with `game_id, season, home_team_id, away_team_id, home_score, away_score, neutral_site`. |
| `ratings` | `DataFrame` |  | One row per team with `season, team_id, adj_em, rank` (the `mbb_team_ratings` output). Team-id dtype must match `results`. |
| `league` | `str` | `'mens'` | `"mens"` or `"womens"` (quad thresholds, HFA, bubble EM). |

**Returns**

One row per (season, team_id): `season, team_id, sos, sos_rank, wab, quad1_w .. quad4_l, quality_wins`. `sos` is the mean opponent `adj_em` (rank 1 = hardest schedule); quads follow the NET venue-adjusted opponent-rank thresholds; `quality_wins` is Quad-1 + Quad-2 wins; `wab` is actual wins minus a bubble-quality team's expected wins against the same schedule. Empty input returns the schema with zero rows.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it needs a schedule with home_team_id / away_team_id columns, and no package function returns one (load_mbb_schedule ships home_id / away_id).

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If the team-id dtypes of `results` and `ratings` disagree. |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_strength_of_schedule import strength_of_schedule
resume = strength_of_schedule(results, ratings)
```
