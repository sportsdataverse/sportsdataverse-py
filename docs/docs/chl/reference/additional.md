**Returns**

Keys are the public function names (e.g. `"ahl_schedule"`).

`most_recent_chl_season() -> 'int'`

Newest CHL regular season as an end-year integer: the highest `season_yr` of a regular season that is not a one-off event, so a preseason listed first is not a default. Raises `NoDataError` when the seasons feed lists none, `AssetFetchError` when it fails.
