### wbb_bracketology {#wbb_bracketology}

`wbb_bracketology(season: 'int', *, as_of_date: 'datetime.date | None' = None, ineligible: 'Iterable[str]' = (), return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Women's daily `bracketology` table: the projected field, seeds and bubble.

Delegates to `sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_bracketology.mbb_bracketology` with `league="womens"` (WBB loaders + women's constants).

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `season` | `int` |  | Season to project (e.g. `2024`). |
| `as_of_date` | `date \| None` | `None` | Only use games strictly before this date; `None` uses every completed game. |
| `ineligible` | `Iterable[str]` | `()` | Team ids barred from the NCAA tournament (in 2024, Southern Indiana won the OVC final while reclassifying; UT Martin took the bid). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas DataFrame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per Division I team -- see the mbb core for the full contract.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `season` | Int64 | Season, named by its end year (2024 is 2023-24). |
| `as_of_date` | Date | The as-of date: only games strictly before it count as played. Null when every completed game is used. |
| `team_id` | String | ESPN team id (Utf8). |
| `team` | String | Team (ESPN location name). |
| `conference` | String | Conference short name. Null for independents, which get no auto-bid. |
| `eligible` | Boolean | False for a team the caller listed as barred from the NCAA tournament (reclassifying to Division I, a postseason ban). It counts in every rating and résumé but gets no bid. |
| `wins` | Int64 | Wins in played games, against every opponent (non-Division I included). |
| `losses` | Int64 | Losses in played games, against every opponent. |
| `net_estimate_rank` | Float64 | NET-estimate rank (strength_of_schedule). |
| `rpi_rank` | Float64 | RPI rank (strength_of_schedule). |

| `quad1_w` | Int64 | Quad 1 wins over Division I opponents (strength_of_schedule). |
| `quad1_l` | Int64 | Quad 1 losses to Division I opponents (strength_of_schedule). |
| `resume_score` | Float64 | Committee-style résumé: 0.35 * adj_em_z + 0.20 * z(sos) + 0.35 * z(wab) + 0.10 * z(quad1_w), over eligible teams. Null for ineligible teams. |
| `auto_bid` | Boolean | Holds the conference's auto-bid: the conference-tournament champion, or before the final the conference leader still alive. |
| `conf_champion` | Boolean | True when the conference-tournament final has been played and this team holds the auto-bid (the runner-up when the champion is ineligible). |
| `at_large_rank` | Int64 | Order among eligible teams without an auto-bid, by resume_score (1 = best). Null for auto-bids and ineligible teams. |
| `bid` | Boolean | In the projected 68-team field. |
| `projected_seed` | Int64 | Projected seed line, 1-16. The last four at-large teams and the four worst auto-bids play the First Four in pairs, so every line has four slots. Null outside the field. |
| `at_large_prob` | Float64 | At-large probability: a logistic in resume_score centred midway between the last at-large team in and the first out. |
| `bubble` | String | last_four_byes (at-large ranks 29-32 with 36 at-large slots), last_four_in (33-36), first_four_out (37-40), next_four_out (41-44); null otherwise. |

### wbb_player_on_off {#wbb_player_on_off}

`wbb_player_on_off(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, min_poss: 'int' = 200, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Women's college player on/off: each player's team with her on the floor and without her.

Delegates to `sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_player_on_off.mbb_player_on_off` with
`league="womens"`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2025` is 2024-25). |

| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id, player_id)`: `games`, `team_games`, the `_on` and `_off` totals and ratings, `<rating>_diff`, the ranks and the sample sizes. `poss_on + poss_off` is the team's possessions. See the mbb core for the definitions.
