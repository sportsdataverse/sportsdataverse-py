# Women's college basketball — additional Python functions — Analytics: wbb_lineup–wbb_situational

### wbb_lineup_seasons {#wbb_lineup_seasons}

`wbb_lineup_seasons(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, min_poss: 'int' = 200, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Women's college lineup seasons: 2-, 3- and 5-man units with ratings, four factors and shot zones.

Delegates to `sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_lineup_seasons.mbb_lineup_seasons` with
`league="womens"`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2025` is 2024-25). |
| `min_poss` | `int` | `200` | The rank gate, offensive plus defensive possessions (default 200). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id, n_players, lineup_id)`: `player_1..5`, `minutes`, `poss` / `opp_poss`, `pts` / `opp_pts`, `plus_minus`, the ratings, the four factors and shot zones for and against, each with `_rank` / `_pct` / `_n`. See the mbb core for the definitions.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2025` is 2024-25). |
| `min_poss` | `int` | `200` | The rank gate, offensive plus defensive possessions both on and off the floor (default 200). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id, player_id)`: `games`, `team_games`, the `_on` and `_off` totals and ratings, `<rating>_diff`, the ranks and the sample sizes. `poss_on + poss_off` is the team's possessions. See the mbb core for the definitions.

| `vorp` | Float64 | Value over replacement player: (rating - R) * poss / the season's possessions per D1 team, R the league's replacement level (REPLACEMENT_LEVEL; MBB -1.66, WBB -1.99 per 100). Basketball-Reference's VORP scale. |
| `war` | Float64 | Wins above replacement against an average D1 schedule: (rating - R) * poss / 100 / points per win (PTS_PER_WIN; MBB 38.91, WBB 47.10). 0 at replacement level; a replacement team wins about .35. |
| `war_lo` | Float64 | Low end of the nominal 90% interval for war (5th percentile of 1000 bootstrap replicates, each team-season seeded on its own): each team-season's games resampled with replacement (a game's player possessions, team possessions and margin move together), then his possessions, the team net rating, the anchoring and the centring recomputed. The source ratings and the replacement level are held fixed, so this is the sampling uncertainty of the team side and the playing time (in college the replicate's adjusted net rating is the adjusted rating plus the change in the raw one); box BPM's own sampling error is in no column. |
| `war_hi` | Float64 | High end of the nominal 90% interval for war (95th percentile of the same 1000 game-resampled replicates as war_lo). |
| `vorp_rank` | Float64 | Rank of vorp within the season among every player (1 = most; ties average); null under 10 players. |
| `war_rank` | Float64 | Rank of war within the season among every player (1 = most; ties average); null under 10 players. |
| `vorp_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of vorp within the season: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the players ranked; null when the rank is null. |
| `war_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of war within the season: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the players ranked; null when the rank is null. |
| `vorp_n` | Int64 | Sample size of vorp: on-court possessions, rounded. |
| `war_n` | Int64 | Sample size of war: on-court possessions, rounded. |
