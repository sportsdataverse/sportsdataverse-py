### wbb_player_war {#wbb_player_war}

`wbb_player_war(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Women's college WAR and VORP per player-season, from our box BPM.

Delegates to `sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_player_war.mbb_player_war` with
`league="womens"`. Box BPM covers every D1 team from 2017 (about 80 teams in 2014-2016).

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2025` is 2024-25). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, player_id)` of a D1 team: `player_name`, `team_id`, `teams`, `min`, `poss`, `rating`, `vorp`, `war` and the `_rank` / `_pct` / `_n` columns. See the mbb core for the definitions.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `season` | Int64 | Season, named by the year it ends (2025 is 2024-25). |
| `player_id` | String | The player's ESPN athlete id, as text (the box-score id the college player-value models key on). |
| `player_name` | String | Player name, from the box score. |
| `team_id` | String | ESPN team id of the Division I team he played the most possessions for. |
| `teams` | Int64 | How many Division I teams he played for. |
| `min` | Float64 | Minutes in the season's box scores. |
| `poss` | Float64 | Possessions: minutes / 40 * the team's adjusted tempo (mbb_team_ratings adj_tempo, possessions per 40 minutes). College has no published on-court possessions for every game. The minutes basis of vorp and war. |
| `rating` | Float64 | Points per 100 possessions above an average Division I player: box BPM (mbb_box_bpm, model 1 of the player-value spine), re-anchored to the team (team mean = adjusted efficiency margin minus the D1 mean, / 5) and centred so the D1 possession-weighted mean is 0. |
| `vorp` | Float64 | Value over replacement player: (rating - R) * poss / the season's possessions per D1 team, R the league's replacement level (REPLACEMENT_LEVEL; MBB -1.66, WBB -1.99 per 100). Basketball-Reference's VORP scale. |
| `war` | Float64 | Wins above replacement against an average D1 schedule: (rating - R) * poss / 100 / points per win (PTS_PER_WIN; MBB 38.91, WBB 47.10). 0 at replacement level; a replacement team wins about .35. |
| `war_lo` | Float64 | Low end of the 90% interval for war (5th percentile of 200 bootstrap replicates): each team-season's games resampled with replacement (a game's player possessions, team possessions and margin move together), then his possessions, the team net rating, the anchoring and the centring recomputed. The source ratings and the replacement level are held fixed, so this is the sampling uncertainty of the team side and the playing time (in college the replicate's adjusted net rating is the adjusted rating plus the change in the raw one). |
| `war_hi` | Float64 | High end of the 90% interval for war (95th percentile of the same 200 game-resampled replicates as war_lo). |
| `vorp_rank` | Float64 | Rank of vorp within the season among every player (1 = most; ties average); null under 10 players. |
| `war_rank` | Float64 | Rank of war within the season among every player (1 = most; ties average); null under 10 players. |
| `vorp_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of vorp within the season: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the players ranked; null when the rank is null. |
| `war_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of war within the season: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the players ranked; null when the rank is null. |
| `vorp_n` | Int64 | Sample size of vorp: on-court possessions, rounded. |
| `war_n` | Int64 | Sample size of war: on-court possessions, rounded. |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.wbb import wbb_player_war
wbb_player_war(2025).select("player_name", "rating", "war").head()

### wbb_team_strength {#wbb_team_strength}

`wbb_team_strength(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Women's college team strength: adjusted ratings, SOS, SOV, tempo and the four factors.

Delegates to `sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_team_strength.mbb_team_strength` with
`league="womens"`. The adjusted ratings are the published `wbb_ratings`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2025` is 2024-25). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id)`: `games`, `wins`, `losses`, `poss`, `opp_poss`, `pts`, `opp_pts`, the adjusted ratings, `sos`, `sov`, the BB-D3 rates and their `_rank` / `_pct` / `_n`. See the mbb core for the definitions.

### weighted_avg {#weighted_avg}

`weighted_avg(mutable_acc: 'LineupStatSet', obj: 'LineupStatSet') -> 'None'`

Merge `obj` into `mutable_acc` with possession weighting.

Faithful port of `LineupUtils.weightedAvg` (`LineupUtils.ts:645`).
Mutates `mutable_acc` in place (matching the upstream mutable-state
contract) and returns `None`. Each call accumulates a **weighted
sum**, not a weighted average -- the companion `completeWeightedAvg`
(upstream `LineupUtils.ts:752`, not yet ported) divides by the
accumulated weight totals to finish the average. The per-field weight
used at each merge step is derived from `obj`'s *own* totals (e.g.
that single lineup's `total_off_fga`), not from any running total on
`mutable_acc` -- callers accumulating many lineups must call
`weighted_avg` once per lineup so every lineup contributes its own
weight.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mutable_acc` | `LineupStatSet` |  | The running accumulator (`LineupStatSet`). Mutated in place; fields absent from the accumulator are initialized to `{"value": 0.0}` (plus `old_value` / `override` when `obj`'s field carries a luck-adjustment `override` marker) before `obj`'s contribution is added. |
| `obj` | `LineupStatSet` |  | The per-lineup `LineupStatSet` document to merge in. |

**Returns**

None. `mutable_acc` is mutated in place.

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `NotImplementedError` | If `obj` carries a `game_info` key -- that merge branch is deliberately deferred (see module docstring). |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_lineup_stats import weighted_avg

acc: dict = {}
weighted_avg(acc, lineup_a)
weighted_avg(acc, lineup_b)
print(acc["off_poss"]["value"])  # plain sum (SUM_FIELDS)

# Two-lineup possession-weighted merge

acc = {}
for lineup in three_lineups:
    weighted_avg(acc, lineup)
# acc now holds weighted SUMS; complete_weighted_avg (not yet
# ported) is required to turn these into rate-stat averages.
```
