| `pythag_win_pct_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of pythag_win_pct within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |

### wbb_team_season_rates {#wbb_team_season_rates}

`wbb_team_season_rates(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Women's college season team rates from possessions, with home/away/close/clutch splits.

Delegates to `sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_team_season_rates.mbb_team_season_rates` with
`league="womens"`. Clutch is a possession in play in the last 5:00 of the 4th quarter (the

with 5:00 or less left, or the one live at the mark: a possession from 5:10 to 4:50 counts in
full, one that ends exactly at 5:00 does not.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2025` is 2024-25). |
