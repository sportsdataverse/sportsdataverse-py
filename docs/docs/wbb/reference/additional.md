# WBB — additional Python functions

Hand-written wrappers, loaders, and helpers in `sportsdataverse.wbb`
not covered by the generated API-endpoint reference above.

## Play-by-play, schedule & rosters

### `espn_wbb_game_officials(game_id: 'int', season: 'int | None' = None, *, raw: 'bool' = False, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False, **kwargs: 'Any') -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame | dict[str, Any]'` {#espn_wbb_game_officials}

Pull the officials assigned to a women's-college-basketball game.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `game_id` | `int` |  | ESPN event identifier (e.g. `401637613` for the 2024 NCAA Division I women's championship game). |
| `season` | `int \| None` | `None` | Season year. Recorded as the `season` column on the output; does NOT alter the request URL because ESPN's officials endpoint keys on event ID alone. |
| `raw` | `bool` | `False` | If True, returns the parsed JSON dict before any flattening. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | If True, returns a pandas DataFrame; otherwise polars. |

**Returns**

Polars (or pandas) DataFrame with one row per official: `game_id`, `season`, `official_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `full_name`, `display_name`, `position_id`, `position_name`, `position_display_name`, `order`. When ESPN ships no officials for the game (often for unscheduled or future events), an empty frame with the documented schema is returned so callers see a stable column set. If `raw=True`, returns the raw response dict.

**Example**

```python

day = espn_wbb_schedule(dates=20240407)
print(day.shape)

# Season-level pull (2024 season)

season = espn_wbb_schedule(dates=2024, limit=1500)
print(season.shape)

# Filter to a specific team (UConn ``team_id=2509``)

import polars as pl
uconn = season.filter(
    (pl.col("home_id") == "2509") | (pl.col("away_id") == "2509")
)

# Pandas round-trip

season_pd = espn_wbb_schedule(dates=2024, return_as_pandas=True)
season_pd.head()
```

### `espn_wbb_team_stats(team_id: 'int', season: 'int', *, raw: 'bool' = False, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False, **kwargs: 'Any') -> 'dict[str, pl.DataFrame] | dict[str, pd.DataFrame] | dict[str, Any]'` {#espn_wbb_team_stats}

Pull ESPN team season stats for a women's-college-basketball team.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `team_id` | `int` |  | ESPN team identifier (e.g. `2509` for UConn). |
| `season` | `int` |  | Season year, forwarded to ESPN as `?season=YYYY`. |
| `raw` | `bool` | `False` | If True, returns the parsed JSON dict before any flattening. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | If True, returns a dict of pandas DataFrames; otherwise polars. |

**Returns**

Dict with one DataFrame per stat category. The canonical keys `"Averages"`, `"Totals"`, `"Misc"` are ALWAYS present; missing categories come back as empty frames carrying the documented schema. Any ESPN-shipped category whose name does not match one of the three canonical keys is collected under an additional `"Other"` key (only added if non-empty). Per-category column set (one row per stat): * `stat_name` (Utf8) * `abbreviation` (Utf8) * `display_value` (Utf8) * `value` (Float64) * `description` (Utf8) * `category` (Utf8, constant per frame) * `team_id` (Int64, constant) * `season` (Int32, constant) If `raw=True`, returns the raw response dict.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.wbb import espn_wbb_team_stats
frames = espn_wbb_team_stats(team_id=2509, season=2025)
print(sorted(frames.keys()))

# Index into a specific table

averages = frames["Averages"]
print(averages.shape)
averages.select(["stat_name", "display_value", "value"]).head()

# Iterate the canonical categories

for cat in ("Averages", "Totals", "Misc"):
    print(cat, frames[cat].shape)

# ``Other`` fallback bucket (only present when ESPN ships a category that does not map onto one of the three canonical keys)

if "Other" in frames:
    frames["Other"].select(["category", "stat_name", "value"])

# Pandas round-trip

frames_pd = espn_wbb_team_stats(
    team_id=2579, season=2025, return_as_pandas=True
)  # team_id 2579 = South Carolina
frames_pd["Averages"].head()
```

## Utilities & helpers

### `most_recent_wbb_season()` {#most_recent_wbb_season}

Return the most recent women's college basketball season year.

The women's college basketball season spans late October through early
April; for any month October-December the "current season" is the
following calendar year (e.g. October 2025 returns `2026`).

**Returns**

The most recent / current season year.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.wbb import most_recent_wbb_season, espn_wbb_schedule
season = most_recent_wbb_season()
sched = espn_wbb_schedule(dates=season)
```

## Other

### `build_efficiency_margins(mutable_stat_set: 'LineupStatSet', key_override: 'str | None' = None) -> 'None'` {#build_efficiency_margins}

Derive `off_net` / `off_raw_net` on a stat set, in place.

Faithful port of `LineupUtils.buildEfficiencyMargins` (`LineupUtils.ts:145`).
`off_net` is `off_adj_ppp - def_adj_ppp` (adjusted efficiency margin);
`off_raw_net` is `off_ppp - def_ppp` (raw/unadjusted margin). Both are
only written when their two source fields are both present on
`mutable_stat_set`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mutable_stat_set` | `LineupStatSet` |  | The `LineupStatSet` (or team-report equivalent) to mutate in place. |
| `key_override` | `str \| None` | `None` | `"value"` or `"old_value"` -- which sub-key to read from the source fields and write into `off_net` / `off_raw_net`. When `None` (the default), the upstream `nonLuckKey` fallback applies: use `"old_value"` if `mutable_stat_set["off_ppp"]["old_value"]` is present, otherwise `"value"`. When given explicitly, the written field is merged onto any existing `off_net` / `off_raw_net` dict (so a second call with the other key preserves the first call's key) rather than replacing it outright. |

**Returns**

None. `mutable_stat_set` is mutated in place.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_lineup_stats import build_efficiency_margins

build_efficiency_margins(team_info, "value")
off_ppp = team_info.get("off_ppp")
if isinstance(off_ppp, dict) and off_ppp.get("old_value") is not None:
    build_efficiency_margins(team_info, "old_value")
print(team_info["off_net"]["value"])
```

### `calculate_aggregated_lineup_stats(lineups: 'list[LineupStatSet] | None') -> 'LineupStatSet'` {#calculate_aggregated_lineup_stats}

Combine all lineups into a single team stat set.

Faithful port of `LineupUtils.calculateAggregatedLineupStats`
(`LineupUtils.ts:106`). Seeds an accumulator from
`StatModels.emptyLineup()` (`{"key": "empty", "doc_count": 0}`) plus
an `all_lineups` sub-accumulator of the same shape, then merges every
lineup via `weighted_avg`: lineups without a truthy `rapmRemove`
key merge into the main accumulator, while `rapmRemove` lineups merge
into `all_lineups` instead (their contribution is folded back in
afterward). Calls `complete_weighted_avg` to turn the main
accumulator's weighted sums into weighted averages, then -- because
`StatModels.emptyLineup()` always carries `key`/`doc_count` and so
is never considered "empty" by the upstream `lodash.isEmpty` check --
unconditionally re-merges the (now-averaged) team totals into
`all_lineups` and finishes that sub-accumulator too. Finally rebuilds
`off_net` / `off_raw_net` via `build_efficiency_margins`
(value-key always; old-value-key too when the team is in luck-adjusted
mode, i.e. `off_ppp.old_value` is present) -- but only on the top-level
result, matching upstream's "don't bother for all_lineups" comment.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lineups` | `list[LineupStatSet] \| None` |  | The per-lineup `LineupStatSet` docs to fold together (e.g. the ES aggregation buckets under `responses[0].aggregations.lineups.buckets`). `None` or an empty list yields an all-zero/empty team stat set (mirrors the upstream `lineups \|\| []` guard). |

**Returns**

The aggregated team-total `LineupStatSet`, including a nested `all_lineups` key holding the `rapmRemove`-lineups-plus-team-total composite sub-aggregate.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_lineup_stats import calculate_aggregated_lineup_stats

buckets = raw_response["responses"][0]["aggregations"]["lineups"]["buckets"]
team_info = calculate_aggregated_lineup_stats(buckets)
print(team_info["off_ppp"]["value"], team_info["off_poss"]["value"])

# RAPM-exclusion flag

buckets[1]["rapmRemove"] = True  # divert into all_lineups instead
team_info = calculate_aggregated_lineup_stats(buckets)
```

### `complete_weighted_avg(mutable_acc: 'LineupStatSet', harmonic_weighting: 'bool' = False, regress_diffs: 'float' = 0.0) -> 'None'` {#complete_weighted_avg}

Finish a `weighted_avg` accumulator into true weighted averages.

Faithful port of `LineupUtils.completeWeightedAvg` (`LineupUtils.ts:752`).
Mutates `mutable_acc` in place and returns `None`, mirroring the
upstream `void` + mutable-arg contract. Recomputes the per-field weight
tables from `mutable_acc` itself (`getSimpleWeights(mutableAcc, 1,
regressDiffs)` -- note the `default_val=1`, unlike `weighted_avg`'s
`default_val=0`), then, unless `harmonic_weighting` is set, calls
recalculate_play_type_poss` to fix up the transition/scramble
possession fields that `weighted_avg` skipped. Finally divides every
non-ignored field's accumulated weighted sum by its matching weight
total (shot-type / `ppp_totals` / `orb_totals` / `fta_totals` /
`ast_totals` / generic FGA fallback); `total_*` and `SUM_FIELDS`
fields are left untouched (they are already true totals, not sums to be
averaged). `off_ftr` / `def_ftr` get a special non-`harmonic_weighting`
recompute straight from the accumulated `total_{off|def}_fta` rather
than dividing their own weighted sum.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mutable_acc` | `LineupStatSet` |  | The `weighted_avg`-accumulated `LineupStatSet` to finish in place. Every field with a non-`total_`/`SUM_FIELDS` key is converted from a weighted sum to a weighted average. |
| `harmonic_weighting` | `bool` | `False` | When `True`, skips the recalculate_play_type_poss` fixup and uses a harmonic-style division for `off_ftr`/`def_ftr` instead of the totals-based recompute. Matches the upstream default (`False`) used by `calculate_aggregated_lineup_stats`. |
| `regress_diffs` | `float` | `0.0` | Forwarded to get_simple_weights` -- regression toward ~1000 possessions for on/off diff calculations. Defaults to `0.0` (no regression), matching `calculate_aggregated_lineup_stats`'s call site. |

**Returns**

None. `mutable_acc` is mutated in place.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_lineup_stats import weighted_avg, complete_weighted_avg

acc: dict = {}
for lineup in lineups:
    weighted_avg(acc, lineup)
complete_weighted_avg(acc)
print(acc["off_ppp"]["value"])  # now a true weighted average
```

### `espn_wbb_teams(groups=None, return_as_pandas=False, **kwargs) -> 'pl.DataFrame'` {#espn_wbb_teams}

espn_wbb_teams - look up the women's college basketball teams

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `groups` | `int` | `None` | Used to define different divisions. 50 is Division I, 51 is Division II/Division III. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | If True, returns a pandas dataframe. If False, returns a polars dataframe. |

**Returns**

Polars dataframe containing teams for the requested league. This function caches by default, so if you want to refresh the data, use the command sportsdataverse.wbb.espn_wbb_teams.clear_cache().

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `team_abbreviation` | character | Short team abbreviation (e.g. 'LAS'). |
| `team_alternate_color` | character | Team alternate color (hex without leading '#'). |
| `team_color` | character | Team primary color (hex without leading '#'). |
| `team_display_name` | character | Full team display name. |
| `team_id` | character | Unique team identifier. |
| `team_is_active` | logical | TRUE if the team is currently active. |
| `team_is_all_star` | logical | TRUE if the row represents an All-Star team. |
| `team_location` | character | Team city or location string. |
| `team_logos` | integer | Team logo metadata. |
| `team_name` | character | Full team display name (e.g. 'Las Vegas Aces'). |
| `team_nickname` | character | Team nickname. |
| `team_short_display_name` | character | Short team display name (e.g. 'Aces'). |
| `team_slug` | character | URL-safe team identifier (e.g. 'lasvegas-aces' / 'aces'). |
| `team_uid` | character | ESPN universal team identifier (UID format 's:40~l:...~t:...'). |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.wbb import espn_wbb_teams
teams = espn_wbb_teams()
print(teams.shape)
print(teams.columns[:8])

# Walk every team-id (handy for batched scrapes)

team_ids = teams["team_id"].to_list()
print(len(team_ids), "D1 teams")

# Pandas round-trip + Division II/III

d2_d3 = espn_wbb_teams(groups=51, return_as_pandas=True)
d2_d3.head()
```

### `get_stats_diff(stat_set1: 'LineupStatSet', stat_set2: 'LineupStatSet', off_title: 'str', def_title: 'str | None' = None) -> 'LineupStatSet'` {#get_stats_diff}

Straight (unweighted) field-by-field diff of two team stat sets.

Faithful port of `LineupUtils.getStatsDiff` (`LineupUtils.ts:185`).
For every field on `stat_set1`, subtracts the matching field's
`value` (and, when both sides carry one, `old_value`) from
`stat_set2`. No possession weighting or regression -- this is a raw
subtraction, unlike `weighted_avg` / `complete_weighted_avg`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stat_set1` | `LineupStatSet` |  | The "from" team stat set (e.g. this team). |
| `stat_set2` | `LineupStatSet` |  | The "to subtract" team stat set (e.g. the opponent, or a prior period). |
| `off_title` | `str` |  | Written into the result's `off_title` field verbatim. |
| `def_title` | `str \| None` | `None` | Written into the result's `def_title` field verbatim (`None` when omitted, mirroring the upstream optional arg). |

**Returns**

A new `LineupStatSet`: one `{"value": ..., "old_value": ..., "override": ...}` dict per field present on `stat_set1`, plus `off_title` / `def_title`. A field becomes `None` (the JS `undefined` analog) instead of a diff dict when either side is missing a `value` -- e.g. because that field was never populated for one of the two stat sets.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_lineup_stats import get_stats_diff

diff = get_stats_diff(team_a, team_b, "Team A", "Team B")
print(diff["off_ppp"]["value"])  # team_a.off_ppp - team_b.off_ppp
```

### `lineup_to_team_report(lineup_report: 'LineupStatSet', inc_replacement: 'bool' = False, regress_diffs: 'float' = 0.0, rep_on_off_diag_mode: 'int' = 0) -> 'LineupStatSet'` {#lineup_to_team_report}

Build per-player on/off splits out of a team's lineups.

Faithful port of `LineupUtils.lineupToTeamReport` (`LineupUtils.ts:277`).
For every distinct player across `lineup_report["lineups"]`, partitions
the team's lineups into ON (the player was on the floor) and OFF (they
weren't) buckets, merging each bucket via `weighted_avg` /
`complete_weighted_avg`. Also builds a `teammates` map of
possession overlap with every other player, and -- when
`inc_replacement=True` -- a "replacement" on-minus-off composite via
combine_replacement_on_off`.

Lineups whose `key` is the empty string are skipped in the
on/off-partition loop (workaround for an upstream data issue, tracked
as upstream issue #53) but still contribute to the player roster.
Every lineup's `rapmRemove` key (if present, e.g. left over from a
prior `calculate_aggregated_lineup_stats` call sharing the same
input list) is deleted as a side effect while building the roster --
`lineup_to_team_report` itself never consults `rapmRemove`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lineup_report` | `LineupStatSet` |  | `{"lineups": [...], "avgOff": ..., "error_code": ...}` -- the per-team lineup list plus metadata (mirrors upstream's `LineupStatsModel`). Only `lineups` and `error_code` are consumed here. |
| `inc_replacement` | `bool` | `False` | When `True`, additionally builds each player's `replacement` on-minus-off composite (more expensive -- scans every OFF lineup against every ON lineup for a 4-of-5-shared- players complement match). |
| `regress_diffs` | `float` | `0.0` | Forwarded to combine_replacement_on_off`'s final `complete_weighted_avg` call -- regression toward ~1000 possessions for the replacement diff (only meaningful when `inc_replacement=True`). |
| `rep_on_off_diag_mode` | `int` | `0` | When `> 0`, retains diagnostic detail (`myLineups` on each player's replacement entry, plus `lineupUsage` bookkeeping) instead of discarding it after use. |

**Returns**

{code: id}, "players": [...], "error_code": ...}`. Each entry in `players` is `{"playerId", "playerCode", "teammates", "on", "off", "replacement"}` -- `on`/`off` are finished `LineupStatSet` averages (or, for a player who's always ON, an all-zero `off`); `replacement` is `None` unless `inc_replacement=True``.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_lineup_stats import lineup_to_team_report

report = lineup_to_team_report({"lineups": buckets, "error_code": None})
for player in report["players"]:
    print(player["playerId"], player["on"]["off_poss"]["value"])

# With replacement (on-minus-off) splits

report = lineup_to_team_report(
    {"lineups": buckets, "error_code": None},
    inc_replacement=True,
    regress_diffs=-500,
)
```

### `scoreboard_event_parsing(event)` {#scoreboard_event_parsing}

_No description available._

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `event` |  |  |  |

### `wbb_pbp_disk(game_id, path_to_json)` {#wbb_pbp_disk}

_No description available._

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `game_id` |  |  |  |
| `path_to_json` |  |  |  |

### `weighted_avg(mutable_acc: 'LineupStatSet', obj: 'LineupStatSet') -> 'None'` {#weighted_avg}

Merge `obj` into `mutable_acc` with possession weighting.

Faithful port of `LineupUtils.weightedAvg` (`LineupUtils.ts:645`).
Mutates `mutable_acc` in place (matching the upstream mutable-state
contract) and returns `None`. Each call accumulates a **weighted
sum**, not a weighted average -- the companion `completeWeightedAvg`
(upstream `LineupUtils.ts:752`, not yet ported) divides by the
accumulated weight totals to finish the average. The per-field weight
used at each merge step is derived from `obj`'s *own* totals (e.g.
that single lineup's `total_off_fga`), not from any running total on
`mutable_acc` -- callers accumulating many lineups must call
`weighted_avg` once per lineup so every lineup contributes its own
weight.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mutable_acc` | `LineupStatSet` |  | The running accumulator (`LineupStatSet`). Mutated in place; fields absent from the accumulator are initialized to `{"value": 0.0}` (plus `old_value` / `override` when `obj`'s field carries a luck-adjustment `override` marker) before `obj`'s contribution is added. |
| `obj` | `LineupStatSet` |  | The per-lineup `LineupStatSet` document to merge in. |

**Returns**

None. `mutable_acc` is mutated in place.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.mbb.mbb_lineup_stats import weighted_avg

acc: dict = {}
weighted_avg(acc, lineup_a)
weighted_avg(acc, lineup_b)
print(acc["off_poss"]["value"])  # plain sum (SUM_FIELDS)

# Two-lineup possession-weighted merge

acc = {}
for lineup in three_lineups:
    weighted_avg(acc, lineup)
# acc now holds weighted SUMS; complete_weighted_avg (not yet
# ported) is required to turn these into rate-stat averages.
```
