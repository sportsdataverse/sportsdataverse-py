# NBA — additional Python functions — Analytics: nba_player–nba_shot

### nba_player_shot_zones {#nba_player_shot_zones}

`nba_player_shot_zones(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Season shot profile by zone per player: rim / mid / corner 3 / above-the-break 3.

One row per player, team and season over the regular season (a traded player has a row per
team). Zones and the unlocated attempts are as in the module docstring.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2026` is 2025-26). The WNBA season is its calendar year. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA or `"10"` WNBA. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id, player_id)` (stats.nba.com ids, Int64) with `player_name`, `games`, `fga`, `fgm`, `unlocated_fga` and, for each zone `z` (`rim`, `mid`, `corner_3`, `above_break_3`), `{z}_fga`, `{z}_fgm`, `{z}_ast` (assisted makes), `{z}_fg_pct`, `{z}_freq` (share of the located attempts) and `{z}_ast_pct` (share of the makes assisted). The four `{z}_fga` plus `unlocated_fga` add up to `fga`. Every rate has `<m>_n` (its denominator), `<m>_rank` (1 = highest) and `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile), ranked within the season among players whose `<m>_n` reaches the rate's gate and null under ten players. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_shot_zone_profiles import nba_player_shot_zones
zones = nba_player_shot_zones(2025)
zones.sort("corner_3_fga", descending=True).select("player_name", "corner_3_fga", "corner_3_fg_pct").head()

wnba = nba_player_shot_zones(2025, league_id="10")
```

### nba_player_war {#nba_player_war}

`nba_player_war(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

WAR and VORP per player-season, from our BPM, RAPM and BOBAN (regular season).

Each rating is anchored to the team (its players' possession-weighted mean rating over the
season is the team's net rating / 5; it is a season constraint, not an estimate for each
five-man lineup) and centred on the league, so 0 is a league-average player. `vorp` is points per
100 team possessions above a replacement player over one team's season of possessions
(Basketball-Reference's VORP scale); `war` is wins above replacement. A replacement-level
player has 0, and a season's `war` adds up to the league's wins minus those of a team of
replacement players. `rating` / `war` are the mean of the three sources; `rating_<s>`
/ `war_<s>` are each one. The replacement level and points per win are fitted per league
(`~sportsdataverse._common.player_war.REPLACEMENT_LEVEL`,
`~sportsdataverse._common.player_war.PTS_PER_WIN`).

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2026` is 2025-26). The WNBA season is its calendar year. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA or `"10"` WNBA. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, player_id)` (stats.nba.com ids, Int64): `player_name`, `team_id` (the team he played most possessions for), `teams` (how many he played for), `min`, `poss` (on-court possessions, offensive plus defensive over 2), `rating` and `rating_bpm` / `rating_rapm` / `rating_boban` (anchored, per 100), `vorp`, `war` with `war_lo` / `war_hi` (a nominal 90% interval from a bootstrap over each team-season's games: the sampling uncertainty of the team side and the playing time) and `war_bpm` / `war_rapm` / `war_boban` (the source spread), with `_rank` (1 = most), `_pct` and `_n` (possessions) for `vorp` and `war` among every player of the season. Sorted by season and `war`. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `season` | Int64 | Season, named by the year it ends (2026 is 2025-26; the WNBA season is its calendar year). |
| `player_id` | Int64 | stats.nba.com player id. |
| `player_name` | String | Player name, from the player impact release. |
| `team_id` | Int64 | stats.nba.com team id of the team he played the most possessions for. |
| `teams` | Int64 | How many teams he played for in the regular season. |
| `min` | Float64 | Regular-season minutes (the player impact release's). |
| `poss` | Float64 | On-court possessions, offensive plus defensive over 2, counted from the stats.nba.com possessions (every possession row, BB-D3's convention). The minutes basis of vorp and war. |
| `rating` | Float64 | Points per 100 possessions above a league-average player: the mean of rating_bpm, rating_rapm and rating_boban. |
| `rating_bpm` | Float64 | Our BPM per 100, team-anchored and centred: the release's bpm with its team constant repaired (minute-weighted team mean = net rating / 5, BPM 2.0's), minus the player's team mean, plus the team's net rating / 5, centred so the league's possession-weighted mean is 0. |
| `rating_rapm` | Float64 | Our prior-informed RAPM (adj_rapm) per 100, team-anchored and centred like rating_bpm. Only the net adj_rapm is read: the o_adj_rapm / d_adj_rapm split carries a +11 / -11 offset. |
| `rating_boban` | Float64 | Our BOBAN (boban_filtered_skill) per 100, team-anchored and centred like rating_bpm. |
| `vorp` | Float64 | Value over replacement player: (rating - R) * poss / the season's possessions per team, R the league's replacement level (REPLACEMENT_LEVEL; NBA -1.98, WNBA -3.18 per 100). Basketball-Reference's VORP scale: a season of possessions at R + 1 is 1. |
| `war` | Float64 | Wins above replacement: (rating - R) * poss / 100 / points per win (PTS_PER_WIN; NBA 31.56, WNBA 31.31). 0 at replacement level; a season's war adds up to the league's wins minus a team of replacement players' (.189 NBA 2024-25, .104 WNBA 2025). |
| `war_lo` | Float64 | Low end of the nominal 90% interval for war (5th percentile of 1000 bootstrap replicates, each team-season seeded on its own): each team-season's games resampled with replacement (a game's player possessions, team possessions and margin move together), then his possessions, the team net rating, the anchoring and the centring recomputed. The source ratings and the replacement level are held fixed, so this is the sampling uncertainty of the team side and the playing time; the war_bpm / war_rapm / war_boban spread is the source uncertainty. |
| `war_hi` | Float64 | High end of the nominal 90% interval for war (95th percentile of the same 1000 game-resampled replicates as war_lo). |
| `war_bpm` | Float64 | war from rating_bpm alone. Every source shares the league's replacement level, so war_bpm, war_rapm and war_boban add up to the same league total. |
| `war_rapm` | Float64 | war from rating_rapm alone. |
| `war_boban` | Float64 | war from rating_boban alone. BOBAN shrinks low-minute players toward average, so the replacement pool carries more war_boban than war_bpm (the replacement level is a box-score level). |
| `vorp_rank` | Float64 | Rank of vorp within the season among every player (1 = most; ties average); null under 10 players. |
| `war_rank` | Float64 | Rank of war within the season among every player (1 = most; ties average); null under 10 players. |
| `vorp_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of vorp within the season: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the players ranked; null when the rank is null. |
| `war_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of war within the season: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the players ranked; null when the rank is null. |
| `vorp_n` | Int64 | Sample size of vorp: on-court possessions, rounded. |
| `war_n` | Int64 | Sample size of war: on-court possessions, rounded. |

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If `league_id` is not `"00"` or `"10"` (checked before any data is loaded). |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_player_war import nba_player_war
war = nba_player_war(2026)
war.select("player_name", "poss", "rating", "vorp", "war").head(10)

### nba_playtype_ratings {#nba_playtype_ratings}

`nba_playtype_ratings(season: 'str', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', off_team: 'Optional[pl.DataFrame]' = None, def_team: 'Optional[pl.DataFrame]' = None, schedule: 'Optional[pl.DataFrame]' = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'`

Season play-type-adjusted offensive/defensive team ratings.

Fetches (or uses injected) Synergy offensive/defensive team frames plus the
league schedule, computes raw per-type efficiency
(`raw_playtype_efficiency`), opponent-adjusts it
(`adjust_playtype_efficiency`), then rolls up to one row per team.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `season` | `str` |  | Season string, e.g. `"2023-24"`. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA (default), `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |
| `off_team` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Injected Synergy offensive team frame (bypasses the live fetch -- used for tests / oracle fixtures). |
| `def_team` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Injected Synergy defensive team frame. |
| `schedule` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Injected `team_id`/`opp_team_id` schedule frame. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas DataFrame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per team: `team_id` (Int64), `adj_off`/`adj_def`/`adj_net` (Float64) roll-ups, plus per-type wide columns `adj_off_ppp_<playtype>`/`adj_def_ppp_<playtype>`/`off_freq_<playtype>` (Float64) for each play type present in the data. `adj_off = Σ_t off_freq_t · adj_off_ppp_t · 100` (symmetric for `adj_def` off `def_freq_t`); `adj_net = adj_off - adj_def`. Returns a zero-row frame with the base roll-up schema when the upstream fetch is empty (sparse-coverage leagues never raise).

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it reads stats.nba.com, which answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on; the function works from a residential IP.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import nba_playtype_ratings
r = nba_playtype_ratings("2023-24")
print(r.sort("adj_off", descending=True).head(10))

# Injected offline (oracle / test) path

r = nba_playtype_ratings("2023-24", off_team=off_df, def_team=def_df, schedule=sched_df)

# Pipeline next step

r.filter(pl.col("adj_net") > 0).sort("adj_net", descending=True)
```

### nba_possession_rate_rows {#nba_possession_rate_rows}

`nba_possession_rate_rows(possessions: 'pl.DataFrame', schedule: 'pl.DataFrame', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', season_type: 'str' = 'regular-season') -> 'pl.DataFrame'`

Map `nba_stats_possessions` rows onto the team-season-rates possession frame.

Keeps the games of `schedule` whose `season_type` matches, takes the home team from the
schedule, and sets each possession's start clock to the previous possession's end clock in the
period (the period length for the first one). Points come from the made-shot counts. A game
whose first period runs past 15 minutes is played in two 20-minute halves (the WNBA through
2005): its periods are 20 minutes, `late` starts with the 2nd half and period 3 is overtime.

`neutral_site` comes from `sportsdataverse.nba.nba_neutral_site`: the 2020 bubbles and
the curated games abroad and NBA Cup knockout games in Las Vegas, by stats `game_id`. The
stats schedule has no neutral-site or venue column, and ESPN's `neutral_site` misses most of
them (it marks the 2023-24 Cup semifinals False).

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `possessions` | `DataFrame` |  | `load_nba_stats_possessions` / `load_wnba_stats_possessions` rows. |
| `schedule` | `DataFrame` |  | `load_nba_stats_schedules` / `load_wnba_stats_schedules` rows (`game_id`, `season_type`, `home_team_id`). |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA (12-minute quarters) or `"10"` WNBA (10-minute quarters). |
| `season_type` | `str` | `'regular-season'` | The schedule `season_type` to keep: `"regular-season"` (the default, stats.nba.com's "Regular Season"; NBA Cup group and knockout games count, the Cup final does not), `"preseason"`, `"playoffs"` or `"play-in"`. |

**Returns**

One row per possession in `~sportsdataverse._common.team_season_rates.RATE_ROWS_SCHEMA`.

| col_name | type | description |

| `end_clock` | Float64 | Seconds left in the period when the possession ends. |
| `offense_team_id` | Int64 | stats.nba.com id of the team with the ball. |
| `defense_team_id` | Int64 | stats.nba.com id of the team on defense. |
| `offense_is_home` | Boolean | True when the offense is the (nominal) home team; it signs the running score for the clutch margin. |
| `neutral_site` | Boolean | Always False: the schedule names a home team for every NBA and WNBA game. |
| `points` | Int64 | Points the offense scored on the possession, from its made shots and free throws (2 * fg2m + 3 * fg3m + ftm). |
| `fga` | Float64 | Offense field-goal attempts on the possession. |
| `fgm` | Float64 | Offense field goals made on the possession. |
| `fg3m` | Float64 | Offense three-pointers made on the possession. |
| `fta` | Float64 | Offense free-throw attempts on the possession. |

| `tov` | Float64 | Offense turnovers on the possession. |
| `ff_poss` | Float64 | Turnover-rate denominator: 1 per possession. |

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If `league_id` is not `"00"` or `"10"`, or `season_type` is not one of the four above. |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_loaders import load_nba_stats_possessions, load_nba_stats_schedules
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_team_season_rates import nba_possession_rate_rows
rows = nba_possession_rate_rows(load_nba_stats_possessions(2025), load_nba_stats_schedules(2025))
```

### nba_rated_priors {#nba_rated_priors}

`nba_rated_priors(season: 'int', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Rated pregame home win probability for every ESPN game of a season, as of each game's date.

The in-game win-probability prior when a game has no betting line
(`~sportsdataverse.nba.nba_game_page.home_prior`'s `rated_home_prob`); see the module
docstring for the model and the as-of boundary.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `season` | `int` |  | The season, named by the year it ends (`2026` is 2025-26); the WNBA season is its calendar year. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA or `"10"` WNBA. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per game of the ESPN schedule release (scheduled games included): `season`, `game_id`, `game_date`, `home_team_id`, `away_team_id` (ESPN ids, Int32, as in the pbp release), `neutral_site`, `stats_game_id`, the two teams' adjusted net ratings before the game (`home_adj_net_rtg`, `away_adj_net_rtg`, per 100), the home term `hfa` (per 100, applied to both offenses), `exp_home_margin` (points) and `rated_home_prob`. The last six are null for a game with no stats.nba.com match (All-Star games and the WNBA Commissioner's Cup final).

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `season` | Int64 | Season, named by the year it ends (the WNBA season is its calendar year). |
| `game_id` | Int64 | ESPN game id (Int32, as in the pbp release). |
| `game_date` | Date | Game date (ESPN schedule); the ratings use the games dated strictly before it. |
| `home_team_id` | Int64 | ESPN home team id. |
| `away_team_id` | Int64 | ESPN away team id. |
| `neutral_site` | Boolean | ESPN's neutral-site flag; a neutral game gets no home term. |
| `stats_game_id` | String | The stats.nba.com / stats.wnba.com game id matched on date and team names; null for a game with no match (All-Star games). |
| `home_adj_net_rtg` | Float64 | Home team's adjusted net rating before the game, points per 100 over an average opponent on a neutral court (the season sim's as-of possession ridge, shrunk toward last season's regressed rating). |
| `away_adj_net_rtg` | Float64 | Away team's adjusted net rating before the game, points per 100, on the same basis. |
| `hfa` | Float64 | The as-of ridge's home term, points per 100 for the home offense over a neutral court (applied to both offenses). |
| `exp_home_margin` | Float64 | Expected home margin in points: (home_adj_net_rtg - away_adj_net_rtg + 2 * hfa) * possessions per game / 100, without the home term at a neutral site. |
| `rated_home_prob` | Float64 | Rated pregame home win probability: Phi(exp_home_margin / margin_sd) with the season sim's probit scale. Pass it to score_win_prob / game_page_tables as rated_home_prob to make it the prior of a game with no line; without it that game gets home-court advantage (0.5 at a neutral site). |

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If `league_id` is not `"00"` or `"10"`. |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_rated_prior import nba_rated_priors
priors = nba_rated_priors(2026)
priors.select("game_id", "game_date", "exp_home_margin", "rated_home_prob").head()

# WNBA

nba_rated_priors(2025, league_id="10")
```

### nba_ratings_panel {#nba_ratings_panel}

`nba_ratings_panel(model: 'AnyModel', possessions: 'pl.DataFrame', dates: 'Optional[Sequence[datetime.date]]' = None, *, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'`

Player-ratings-through-date long panel: one row per (player_id, date).

Refit-per-checkpoint (v1; no warm-start incrementality) — each date's row
calls `ratings_as_of` independently, so the panel is leakage-free by
construction: a possession dated after a given checkpoint can never affect
that checkpoint's row, no matter what other dates are also being computed
or what future rows exist in `possessions`. Cost is a full refit per
checkpoint date; for a season's sparse RAPM-family design this is seconds
per date, not minutes — acceptable for a nightly/daily cadence but not for
live in-game updating (out of scope; see spec non-goals).

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `model` | `AnyModel` |  | A harness model conforming to `nba_model_validation.AnyModel`. |
| `possessions` | `DataFrame` |  | A possession+lineup frame with a `game_date` (`pl.Date`) column (as emitted by `compile_nba_season`). |
| `dates` | `Optional[Sequence[date]]` | `None` | Checkpoint dates to compute. `None` (default) uses every distinct `game_date` present in `possessions`, sorted ascending — a rating for every game day, matching what EPM/LEBRON publish nightly. Duplicates are deduped; input order does not matter (the output is always sorted by date). |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return pandas instead of polars. |

**Returns**

Long frame with `RATINGS_PANEL_SCHEMA` columns (`player_id`, `date`, `o_rating`, `d_rating`, `rating`). Zero-row (that schema) when `possessions` is empty or no date yields any players.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: its possessions input needs a game_date column, and neither nba_possessions nor the released possessions carry one.

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If `possessions` (non-empty) lacks a `game_date` column. |

**Example**

```python
import datetime
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_model_validation import RidgeRapmModel
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_ratings_panel import nba_ratings_panel

checkpoints = [datetime.date(2023, 11, 1), datetime.date(2023, 12, 1)]
panel = nba_ratings_panel(RidgeRapmModel(), season_poss, dates=checkpoints)
print(panel.filter(pl.col("player_id") == 201939).sort("date"))

# Every game day, no explicit grid

panel = nba_ratings_panel(RidgeRapmModel(), season_poss)
```

### nba_raw_store_season_frame {#nba_raw_store_season_frame}

`nba_raw_store_season_frame(endpoint: 'str', season: 'int', variant: 'Optional[str]' = None, *, result_set: 'Optional[str]' = None, raw_store_dir: 'RawStoreDir' = None) -> "Optional['pl.DataFrame']"`

Read a committed SEASON-LEVEL capture from the raw store, parsed to a frame.

The per-game half of the store is served by the read-through per-game path;
this is the season-keyed half (`leaguegamelog`, `playerindex`,
`leaguedashplayerbiostats`, ...) that the `-raw` scraper writes as

* `{endpoint}/{season}/{variant}.json` -- parameterized captures, where
  *variant* is the slugified parameter sweep (e.g. `"regular-season"`,
  `"regular-season_totals"`), and
* `{endpoint}/{season}.json` -- unparameterized captures (e.g.
  `playerindex`), i.e. `variant=None`.

Roots may be a local checkout or an `http(s)://` base (the raw repo served
over raw.githubusercontent / a CDN), so a consumer -- notably the
`hoopR-nba-stats-data` model producer -- runs clone-free in CI against the
same committed tree the per-game compile reads.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `endpoint` | `str` |  | stats.nba.com endpoint slug (the store subdirectory). |
| `season` | `int` |  | Season **END** year (2024 = 2023-24) -- the key both halves of the store are filed under. |
| `variant` | `Optional[str]` | `None` | Capture variant slug, or `None` for an unparameterized capture. |
| `result_set` | `Optional[str]` | `None` | Named result set to return when the payload carries several; defaults to the first frame that parses. |
| `raw_store_dir` | `RawStoreDir` | `None` | Store root spec (dir or URL base) or per-endpoint mapping; `None` falls back to the env vars, `""` disables. |

**Returns**

The parsed `polars.DataFrame`, or `None` when the store is unset, the capture is absent, or the payload carries no usable frame -- so a caller can cleanly fall back to a live fetch.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `season_id` | String | Unique season identifier. |
| `team_id` | Int64 | Unique team identifier. |
| `team_abbreviation` | String | Short team abbreviation (e.g. 'LAS'). |

| `wl` | String | Wl. |
| `min` | Int64 | Minutes played. |
| `fgm` | Int64 | Field goals made. |
| `fga` | Int64 | Field goal attempts. |
| `fg_pct` | Float64 | Field goal percentage (0-1). |
| `fg3_m` | Int64 | Three-point field goals made. |
| `fg3_a` | Int64 | Three-point field goal attempts. |
| `fg3_pct` | Float64 | Three-point field goal percentage (0-1). |
| `ftm` | Int64 | Free throws made. |
| `fta` | Int64 | Free throw attempts. |
| `ft_pct` | Float64 | Free throw percentage (0-1). |
| `oreb` | Int64 | Offensive rebounds. |
| `dreb` | Int64 | Defensive rebounds. |
| `reb` | Int64 | Rebounds per game. |
| `ast` | Int64 | Assists. |
| `stl` | Int64 | Steals. |
| `blk` | Int64 | Blocks. |
| `tov` | Int64 | Turnovers. |
| `pf` | Int64 | Personal fouls. |
| `pts` | Int64 | Points scored. |
| `plus_minus` | Int64 | Plus/minus point differential while on court. |
| `video_available` | Int64 | Video available. |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import nba_raw_store_season_frame
base = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportsdataverse/hoopR-nba-stats-raw/main/nba_stats/json"
logs = nba_raw_store_season_frame("leaguegamelog", 2024, "regular-season", raw_store_dir=base)

# Fall back to a live fetch when the capture is absent

frame = nba_raw_store_season_frame("playerindex", 2024, raw_store_dir=base)
positions = frame if frame is not None else nba_stats_playerindex(season="2023-24")
```

### nba_referee_assignments {#nba_referee_assignments}

`nba_referee_assignments(date: 'str | _dt.date', *, league: 'str' = 'nba', raw: 'bool' = False, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False, proxy: 'dict | None' = None) -> 'dict[str, Any]'`

Fetch and parse NBA referee assignments for a given date from official.nba.com.

Retrieves one league's referee crew assignments and replay-center officials for a
date: NBA, G-League or WNBA, picked by `league` (`raw=True` returns all three
leagues' blocks). The `crew_position` column (1–4) represents the feed's slot
order; slot 1 is inferred to be the crew chief. The `season` column converts
from the feed's format to an END year: START+1 for NBA/G-League
(two-calendar-year seasons) and START unchanged for WNBA.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `date` | `str \| date` |  | The date to fetch assignments for (str in "YYYY-MM-DD" format or datetime.date). |
| `league` | `str` | `'nba'` | The league to extract ("nba", "gl", or "wnba"). Defaults to "nba". |
| `raw` | `bool` | `False` | If True, return the raw JSON payload (dict) with all three leagues instead of parsed DataFrames. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | If True, return pandas DataFrames instead of polars. |
| `proxy` | `dict \| None` | `None` | Optional proxy dict passed through to the HTTP layer. |

**Returns**

If `raw=True`, the raw JSON dict with keys "nba", "gl", "wnba". Otherwise, a dict with keys `"officials"` and `"replay_center"` mapping to DataFrames as documented in `parse_nba_referee_assignments`.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `officials.league` | String | League the assignment belongs to: nba, gl (G League), or wnba. |
| `officials.game_id` | String | 10-digit game id (zero-padded) for the assigned game. |
| `officials.game_date` | Date | Game date parsed from the feed's MM/DD/YYYY format. |
| `officials.season` | Int64 | Season end year, converted from the feed's <season-type digit><start year> code: start year + 1 for NBA/G League's two-calendar-year seasons, start year unchanged for WNBA's single-year seasons. |
| `officials.season_type` | String | Season type decoded from the feed's season code first digit: preseason, regular, all-star, playoffs, play-in, or nba-cup-final. |
| `officials.game_code` | String | League game code in YYYYMMDD/AWYHOM format, matching the away and home team abbreviations. |
| `officials.home_team_id` | Int64 | 10-digit team id of the home team. |
| `officials.home_team_abbr` | String | Three-letter abbreviation of the home team. |
| `officials.away_team_id` | Int64 | 10-digit team id of the away team. |
| `officials.away_team_abbr` | String | Three-letter abbreviation of the away team. |
| `officials.crew_position` | Int64 | Feed's official slot order (1-4); slot 1 is inferred to be the crew chief since the API does not label roles. |
| `officials.official_id` | Int64 | Numeric official id from the feed (source field official{n}_code); expected to match stats.nba.com's OFFICIAL_ID. |
| `officials.official_name` | String | Official's display name for this crew slot. |
| `officials.jersey_num` | String | Official's jersey number as a string, from the feed's official{n}_JNum field. |
| `replay_center.league` | String | League the replay-center staffing belongs to: nba, gl, or wnba. |
| `replay_center.game_date` | Date | Date the replay-center official worked; a date-level staffing record, not tied to one game. |
| `replay_center.official_id` | Int64 | Numeric replay-center official id from the feed. |
| `replay_center.official_name` | String | Replay-center official's display name for that date. |

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If league is not "nba", "gl", or "wnba", or date is not a valid "YYYY-MM-DD" date (checked before any request). |
| `NoDataError` | Official.nba.com answered 404, or 403 with S3's `AccessDenied` body. A date without games is not this: it comes back as a 200 with empty `rows` (see the Note). |
| `AssetFetchError` | The fetch failed (network error, rate limit, or Akamai WAF block), the 200 body is not a JSON object, or the league's `Table`/`Table1` rows are missing or malformed (a `Table` row without a 10-digit `game_id`, or a `Table1` row without a `replaycenter_official` name, included). With `raw=True` all three leagues are checked, since the whole payload is returned. |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_officiating import nba_referee_assignments
result = nba_referee_assignments("2026-06-13")
officials = result["officials"]
print(f"Found {officials.height} official slots")

# Fetch WNBA assignments for the same date

result = nba_referee_assignments("2026-06-13", league="wnba")
wnba_officials = result["officials"]
```

### nba_season_sim {#nba_season_sim}

`nba_season_sim(season: 'int', *, as_of_date: 'dt.date | None' = None, league_id: 'str' = '00', n_sims: 'int' = 10000, seed: 'int' = 20261103, chances: 'list[float] | None' = None, cup_schedule: 'pl.DataFrame | None' = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Season sim as of a date: projected W-L, division, seed, play-in, playoff and lottery odds.

Reads the `{nba,wnba}_stats_schedules` and `_possessions` releases for the season and the
one before, fits the game model on the regular-season games played before `as_of_date`,
shrunk toward last season's final ratings (`as_of_game_model`, `preseason_prior`),
and simulates the rest (`simulate_pro_season`). Before the first game the ratings are
the prior alone. The rules applied to each simulated season
are in `sportsdataverse.nba.nba_season_rules`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `season` | `int` |  | The season, named by the year it ends (`2027` is 2026-27); the WNBA season is its calendar year. |
| `as_of_date` | `date \| None` | `None` | Games on or after this date are simulated even when the release has their score (a backtest). None: every game with a score counts as played. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA or `"10"` WNBA. |
| `n_sims` | `int` | `10000` | Simulated seasons (Monte Carlo error: see `SIM_SCHEMA`'s `_se` columns). |
| `seed` | `int` | `20261103` | Seeds the generator; the same release data and seed give the same output. |
| `chances` | `list[float] \| None` | `None` | Lottery chances per slot, worst record first, one per lottery team; overrides the published table (needed for the 2027 WNBA lottery's seven teams, not published yet). |
| `cup_schedule` | `DataFrame \| None` | `None` | NBA: stats.nba.com's schedule for the season (`~sportsdataverse.nba.nba_stats.nba_stats_scheduleleaguev2`), which marks the Cup games. Read only while the release lists TBD Cup games; None fetches it then (a residential connection), and a failed fetch falls back to league-average opponents for the Cup slots with a warning. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per team (stats.nba.com `team_id`, Int64), sorted by conference and mean seed: * `wins` / `losses` so far, `games_remaining`, and the as-of `adj_net_rtg` with its posterior sd `adj_net_rtg_sd` (capped so two teams' shift carries at most 3/4 of a game's variance; it binds only near the prior, before many games are played). * `proj_wins` / `proj_losses` (means), `proj_wins_sd`, the 10th and 90th percentiles, and `proj_wins_se` (the Monte Carlo error of the mean). * `p_division` (NBA), `p_seed_1` .. `p_seed_15` (the regular-season finish in the conference, NBA, or the league, WNBA) and `mean_seed`. * `p_top4` (first-round home court), `p_top6` (NBA, straight to the playoffs), `p_play_in` (NBA, seeds 7-10), `p_playoffs` (NBA: top 6 or through the play-in; WNBA: top 8) and its Monte Carlo `p_playoffs_se`. * `p_lottery`, `p_pick_1`, `p_drawn_pick` (a pick from the drawing: the NBA's top four, the WNBA's top two) and `mean_pick` (given a lottery finish). The pick columns are null when the league has no published chances for that many lottery teams. * `n_sims`.

`nba_season_standings(games: 'pl.DataFrame', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', seed: 'int' = 0, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Standings with the league's tiebreakers from completed regular-season games.

NBA: conference seeds and division ranks under the NBA tie-break procedure (division leaders

nba_season_standings(load_nba_stats_schedules(2025)).filter(pl.col("seed") <= 10)
```

### nba_shot_value {#nba_shot_value}

`nba_shot_value(player_ids: "'list[int]'", season: 'str', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', include_context: 'bool' = False, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> "'dict[str, Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]]'"`

One-call shot-value spine: fetch, score, and run all five models.

Fetches each player's `shotchartdetail`, scores per-shot expected points
from the free `LeagueAverages` zone table, and returns the scored shots
plus shooter talent, selection quality, and zone-value maps (and the
defender/shot-clock context tables when `include_context=True`).

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `player_ids` | `list[int]` |  | Player ids to fetch. |
| `season` | `str` |  | Season string, e.g. `"2022-23"`. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA, `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |
| `include_context` | `bool` | `False` | Also fetch + return the `playerdashptshots` defender/shot-clock context tables, once per player and team his fetched shots came from. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return pandas frames instead of polars. |

**Returns**

`{"shots", "talent", "selection", "zones"}` (plus `"context"` when requested). An empty fetch returns a dict of zero-row frames.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import nba_shot_value
out = nba_shot_value([201939], "2022-23")
out["talent"].head()
```

### nba_shot_value_lineups {#nba_shot_value_lineups}

`nba_shot_value_lineups(group_id: 'str', season: 'str', *, team_id: 'int', league_id: 'str' = '00', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

Scored per-shot frame for one 5-man lineup (`shotchartlineupdetail`).

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `group_id` | `str` |  | The 5-man lineup group id (dash-joined player ids); kept `Utf8`. |
| `season` | `str` |  | Season string, e.g. `"2022-23"`. |
| `team_id` | `int` |  | The lineup's team id. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA, `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas DataFrame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

The lineup's shots scored by `score_shot_xpoints` (with `xpoints`). Empty fetch returns the augmented zero-row schema.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it reads stats.nba.com, which answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on; the function works from a residential IP.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import nba_shot_value_lineups
df = nba_shot_value_lineups("201939-202691-...", "2022-23", team_id=1610612744)
```
