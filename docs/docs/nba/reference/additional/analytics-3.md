# NBA — additional Python functions — Analytics: nba_season–nba_tracking

### nba_season_sim {#nba_season_sim}

`nba_season_sim(season: 'int', *, as_of_date: 'dt.date | None' = None, league_id: 'str' = '00', n_sims: 'int' = 10000, seed: 'int' = 20261103, chances: 'list[float] | None' = None, cup_schedule: 'pl.DataFrame | None' = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Season sim as of a date: projected W-L, division, seed, play-in, playoff and lottery odds.

Reads the `{nba,wnba}_stats_schedules` and `_possessions` releases for the season and the
one before, fits the game model on the regular-season games played before `as_of_date`,
shrunk toward last season's final ratings (`as_of_game_model`, `preseason_prior`),
and simulates the rest (`simulate_pro_season`). Before the first game the ratings are
the prior alone. The rules applied to each simulated season
are in `sportsdataverse.nba.nba_season_rules`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `season` | `int` |  | The season, named by the year it ends (`2027` is 2026-27); the WNBA season is its calendar year. |
| `as_of_date` | `date \| None` | `None` | Games on or after this date are simulated even when the release has their score (a backtest). None: every game with a score counts as played. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA or `"10"` WNBA. |
| `n_sims` | `int` | `10000` | Simulated seasons (Monte Carlo error: see `SIM_SCHEMA`'s `_se` columns). |
| `seed` | `int` | `20261103` | Seeds the generator; the same release data and seed give the same output. |
| `chances` | `list[float] \| None` | `None` | Lottery chances per slot, worst record first, one per lottery team; overrides the published table (needed for the 2027 WNBA lottery's seven teams, not published yet). |
| `cup_schedule` | `DataFrame \| None` | `None` | NBA: stats.nba.com's schedule for the season (`~sportsdataverse.nba.nba_stats.nba_stats_scheduleleaguev2`), which marks the Cup games. Read only while the release lists TBD Cup games; None fetches it then (a residential connection), and a failed fetch falls back to league-average opponents for the Cup slots with a warning. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per team (stats.nba.com `team_id`, Int64), sorted by conference and mean seed: * `wins` / `losses` so far, `games_remaining`, and the as-of `adj_net_rtg` with its posterior sd `adj_net_rtg_sd` (capped so two teams' shift carries at most 3/4 of a game's variance; it binds only near the prior, before many games are played). * `proj_wins` / `proj_losses` (means), `proj_wins_sd`, the 10th and 90th percentiles, and `proj_wins_se` (the Monte Carlo error of the mean). * `p_division` (NBA), `p_seed_1` .. `p_seed_15` (the regular-season finish in the conference, NBA, or the league, WNBA) and `mean_seed`. * `p_top4` (first-round home court), `p_top6` (NBA, straight to the playoffs), `p_play_in` (NBA, seeds 7-10), `p_playoffs` (NBA: top 6 or through the play-in; WNBA: top 8) and its Monte Carlo `p_playoffs_se`. * `p_lottery`, `p_pick_1`, `p_drawn_pick` (a pick from the drawing: the NBA's top four, the WNBA's top two) and `mean_pick` (given a lottery finish). The pick columns are null when the league has no published chances for that many lottery teams. * `n_sims`.

```

### nba_season_standings {#nba_season_standings}

`nba_season_standings(games: 'pl.DataFrame', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', seed: 'int' = 0, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Standings with the league's tiebreakers from completed regular-season games.

NBA: conference seeds and division ranks under the NBA tie-break procedure (division leaders
first, postseason-eligible = a top-10 conference record). WNBA: one league table under the
WNBA procedure. The rules and their sources are in `sportsdataverse.nba.nba_season_rules`.

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id)` that played: `conference` / `division` (NBA; the WNBA rows say `"WNBA"`), `games`, `wins`, `losses`, `win_pct`, `point_diff`, `division_rank` (1 = the division winner), `division_leader`, `seed` (rank in the conference for the NBA, in the league for the WNBA, 1 = best) and `games_back` (behind the seed-1 team). Sorted by season, conference and seed.

| col_name | type | description |

| `TypeError` | If the team-id columns are not Int64. |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_loaders import load_nba_stats_schedules
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_season_rules import nba_season_standings
nba_season_standings(load_nba_stats_schedules(2025)).filter(pl.col("seed") <= 10)
```

### nba_shot_value {#nba_shot_value}

`nba_shot_value(player_ids: "'list[int]'", season: 'str', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', include_context: 'bool' = False, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> "'dict[str, Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]]'"`

One-call shot-value spine: fetch, score, and run all five models.

Fetches each player's `shotchartdetail`, scores per-shot expected points
from the free `LeagueAverages` zone table, and returns the scored shots
plus shooter talent, selection quality, and zone-value maps (and the
defender/shot-clock context tables when `include_context=True`).

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `player_ids` | `list[int]` |  | Player ids to fetch. |
| `season` | `str` |  | Season string, e.g. `"2022-23"`. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA, `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |
| `include_context` | `bool` | `False` | Also fetch + return the `playerdashptshots` defender/shot-clock context tables, once per player and team his fetched shots came from. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return pandas frames instead of polars. |

**Returns**

`{"shots", "talent", "selection", "zones"}` (plus `"context"` when requested). An empty fetch returns a dict of zero-row frames.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import nba_shot_value
out = nba_shot_value([201939], "2022-23")
out["talent"].head()
```

### nba_shot_value_lineups {#nba_shot_value_lineups}

`nba_shot_value_lineups(group_id: 'str', season: 'str', *, team_id: 'int', league_id: 'str' = '00', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

Scored per-shot frame for one 5-man lineup (`shotchartlineupdetail`).

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `group_id` | `str` |  | The 5-man lineup group id (dash-joined player ids); kept `Utf8`. |
| `season` | `str` |  | Season string, e.g. `"2022-23"`. |
| `team_id` | `int` |  | The lineup's team id. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA, `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |

**Returns**

The lineup's shots scored by `score_shot_xpoints` (with `xpoints`). Empty fetch returns the augmented zero-row schema.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it reads stats.nba.com, which answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on; the function works from a residential IP.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import nba_shot_value_lineups
df = nba_shot_value_lineups("201939-202691-...", "2022-23", team_id=1610612744)
```

### nba_team_clutch {#nba_team_clutch}

`nba_team_clutch(season: 'int', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'`

Opponent-agnostic clutch skill (shrunk clutch net-rating delta) per team.

Loads the season's clutch net rating (`nba_stats_leaguedashteamclutch`)
and full-game net baseline (`nba_stats_leaguedashteamstats`), computes
`clutch_delta`, and applies `shrink_clutch`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `season` | `int` |  | End year of the season (e.g. `2024` for 2023-24). |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA / `"10"` WNBA / `"20"` G-League. |

**Returns**

One row per team: `season, team_id, clutch_net_rating, adj_net_rtg, clutch_delta, clutch_skill_shrunk, clutch_poss`. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it reads stats.nba.com, which answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on; the function works from a residential IP.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_clutch import nba_team_clutch
skill = nba_team_clutch(2024)
skill.sort("clutch_skill_shrunk", descending=True).head()
```

### nba_team_luck {#nba_team_luck}

`nba_team_luck(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', season_type: 'str' = 'regular-season', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Luck and close-game record: Pythagorean expected wins vs actual wins, and close-game W-L.

One row per team and season. `exp_wins` is the Pythagorean expectation on the season's
final scores, `games * pts^x / (pts^x + opp_pts^x)`, with the exponent `x` fitted per
league on past seasons (`~sportsdataverse._common.team_luck.PYTHAG_EXPONENT`).
`luck_wins` is `wins - exp_wins`. A close game is one within 5 points at the start of a
possession in the last 5:00 of the 4th quarter or in overtime (stats.nba.com's clutch
window; BB-D3's `close` split).

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2026` is 2025-26). The WNBA season is its calendar year. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA or `"10"` WNBA. |
| `season_type` | `str` | `'regular-season'` | `"regular-season"` (default), `"preseason"`, `"playoffs"` or `"play-in"`, matched to the schedule's `season_type`. The exponent was fitted on regular seasons; on a handful of playoff or play-in games `exp_wins` is only indicative. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id)`; `team_id` is the stats.nba.com team id (Int64). `games`, `wins`, `losses`, `pts` and `opp_pts` are from the final scores; `win_pct`, `pythag_win_pct`, `exp_wins` and `luck_wins` (`wins - exp_wins`) follow. `pbp_games` counts the games with published possessions, and `close_games`, `close_wins`, `close_losses` and `close_win_pct` (null with no close game) are the close games among them. `pythag_win_pct`, `luck_wins` and `close_win_pct` have `<m>_rank` (1 = highest), `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile) and `<m>_n` (games, or close games); ranks are within the season, among teams with at least half the most games (`close_win_pct` also needs possessions for half of them and five close games), and null under five teams. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

| col_name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `season` | Int64 | Season, named by the year it ends (2026 is 2025-26). |
| `team_id` | Int64 | stats.nba.com team id (the 10-digit franchise id). |
| `games` | Int64 | Games in the season type's completed games (the stats schedule's final scores). |
| `wins` | Int64 | Wins in the season type's completed games (the stats schedule's final scores). |

| `pts` | Int64 | Points scored in those games (final scores). |
| `opp_pts` | Int64 | Points allowed in those games (final scores). |
| `win_pct` | Float64 | Win fraction: wins divided by games, from the final scores. |
| `pythag_win_pct` | Float64 | Pythagorean win fraction: pts^x / (pts^x + opp_pts^x), x = PYTHAG_EXPONENT['nba'] (PYTHAG_EXPONENT['wnba'] with league_id='10'), fitted on past seasons by tools/fit_team_luck_pythag.py. |
| `exp_wins` | Float64 | Expected wins: pythag_win_pct * games. |
| `luck_wins` | Float64 | Luck in wins: wins minus exp_wins. Positive means the team won more games than its scoring says it should have. |
| `pbp_games` | Int64 | Games with published possessions (nba_stats_possessions); close_games is counted among these. A game whose late possessions are missing from the release counts as not close. |
| `close_games` | Int64 | Close games: at least one possession started with 5:00 or less left in the 4th quarter or an overtime, the score within 5 (stats.nba.com's clutch window; BB-D3's close split). The margin is the running sum of the possessions' points, so it can drift from the scoreboard: NBA 2025-26 agrees with an independent ESPN play-by-play recount on 1210 of 1229 games. |

| `luck_wins_rank` | Float64 | Rank of luck_wins within the season (the highest value ranks 1; ties average), among teams that played at least half the most games any team played in the season; null for a non-qualifier, a null value, or fewer than five qualifiers, or when every qualifier has the same value. |
| `close_win_pct_rank` | Float64 | Rank of close_win_pct within the season (the highest value ranks 1; ties average), among teams that played at least half the most games any team played in the season, have possessions for at least half their games and played at least five close games (MIN_CLOSE_GAMES); null otherwise, for a null value, or with fewer than five qualifiers, or when every qualifier has the same value. |
| `pythag_win_pct_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of pythag_win_pct within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |
| `luck_wins_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of luck_wins within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |
| `close_win_pct_pct` | Float64 | Percentile of close_win_pct within the season among the same qualified teams: 100 * (n + 1 - rank) / (n + 1), n the number ranked, so the best team is under 100 and nobody is 0; null when the rank is null. |

| `ValueError` | If `league_id` is not `"00"` or `"10"`, or `season_type` is not one of the four above (checked before any data is loaded). |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_team_luck import nba_team_luck
luck = nba_team_luck(2026)
luck.sort("luck_wins", descending=True).select("team_id", "wins", "exp_wins", "luck_wins").head()

# WNBA via ``league_id``

wnba = nba_team_luck(2025, league_id="10")
```

### nba_team_season_rates {#nba_team_season_rates}

`nba_team_season_rates(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', season_type: 'str' = 'regular-season', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Season team rates from possessions: ORtg/DRtg/net, pace and the four factors, with splits.

One row per team, season and split (`all`, `home`, `away`, `close`, `clutch`).
Clutch is a possession that starts with 5:00 or less left in the 4th quarter or an overtime,
the score within 5 (stats.nba.com's clutch window); a close game is one with a clutch
possession. The full definitions are in `sportsdataverse._common.team_season_rates`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2026` is 2025-26). The WNBA season is its calendar year. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA or `"10"` WNBA. |
| `season_type` | `str` | `'regular-season'` | `"regular-season"` (default), `"preseason"`, `"playoffs"` or `"play-in"`, matched to the schedule's `season_type`. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id, split)`. `team_id` is the stats.nba.com team id (Int64). `games`, `poss` / `opp_poss` (offensive / defensive possessions) and `pts` / `opp_pts` are the split's totals. The twelve rates are `off_rtg`, `def_rtg`, `net_rtg` (per 100 possessions), `pace` (possessions per 48 minutes, 40 in the WNBA), the four factors `efg_pct`, `tov_pct`, `orb_pct`, `ft_rate` and the same four against (`opp_*`), all fractions. Each rate has `<m>_rank` (1 = best; `def_rtg`, `tov_pct`, `opp_efg_pct`, `opp_orb_pct` and `opp_ft_rate` rank low first; pace ranks high first), `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile) and `<m>_n` (the sample: possessions for the ratings, games for pace, field-goal attempts for eFG% and FT rate, possessions for turnover rate, rebound chances for ORB%). Ranks are within the season and split, among teams with at least half the most games, and null under five teams. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If `league_id` is not `"00"` or `"10"`, or `season_type` is not one of the four above. |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_team_season_rates import nba_team_season_rates
rates = nba_team_season_rates(2026)
rates.filter(split="all").sort("net_rtg_rank").head()

### nba_team_strength {#nba_team_strength}

`nba_team_strength(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', season_type: 'str' = 'regular-season', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Team strength from possessions: adjusted ratings, SOS, SOV, pace and the four factors.

One row per team and season. The adjusted ratings are a ridge regression of points per 100
on each possession on offense, defense and home terms (penalty
`~sportsdataverse._common.team_strength.RIDGE_LAMBDA`, fit by season-disjoint CV):
points scored / allowed per 100 against an average opponent on a neutral court. SOS is the
mean opponent `adj_net_rtg` over the team's games, SOV the same over its wins.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2026` is 2025-26). The WNBA season is its calendar year. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA or `"10"` WNBA. |
| `season_type` | `str` | `'regular-season'` | `"regular-season"` (default), `"preseason"`, `"playoffs"` or `"play-in"`, matched to the schedule's `season_type`. The ridge, the rates and the games all use it. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id)`; `team_id` is the stats.nba.com team id (Int64). `games`, `poss` / `opp_poss`, `pts` / `opp_pts` are the season totals from the possessions; `wins` / `losses` come from the schedule's final scores. The rated metrics are `adj_off_rtg`, `adj_def_rtg`, `adj_net_rtg`, `sos`, `sov` and the BB-D3 rates (`off_rtg`, `def_rtg`, `net_rtg`, `pace`, the four factors and the four against). Each has `<m>_rank` (1 = best; `adj_def_rtg`, `def_rtg`, `tov_pct` and the opponent shooting, rebounding and free-throw rates rank low first; `sos` ranks the hardest schedule first), `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile) and `<m>_n` (possessions for the ratings, completed games against a rated opponent for SOS, games for pace, wins over a rated opponent for SOV). Ranks are within the season, among teams with at least half the most games, and null under five teams. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If `league_id` is not `"00"` or `"10"`, or `season_type` is not one of the four above (checked before any data is loaded). |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_team_strength import nba_team_strength
strength = nba_team_strength(2026)
strength.sort("adj_net_rtg_rank").select("team_id", "adj_net_rtg", "sos", "sov").head()

# WNBA via ``league_id``

wnba = nba_team_strength(2025, league_id="10")
```

### nba_tracking_drive_value {#nba_tracking_drive_value}

`nba_tracking_drive_value(seasons: "'int | str | list'", *, league_id: 'str' = '00', per_mode: 'str' = 'Totals', by_position: 'bool' = True, positions: 'Optional[pl.DataFrame]' = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False, _get_fn: 'Optional[Callable[..., dict]]' = None) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

Drive value over expected + rim-pressure, per player-season.

Fetches the `Drives` `leaguedashptstats` measure and computes
`drive_pts_oe = drive_pts - drives * bucket_pts_per_drive`. `rim_pressure`
is the z-score of `drive_fta / drives` within the player's role bucket
(a proxy for foul-drawing pressure independent of scoring efficiency).
`drive_ast`/`drive_tov` are passed through unchanged.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| str \| list` |  | A single season or list of seasons. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA (default), `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |
| `per_mode` | `str` | `'Totals'` | `per_mode_simple` passed to the fetch (default `"Totals"`). |
| `by_position` | `bool` | `True` | Compute the baseline within role buckets (default); `False` forces one league-wide bucket. |
| `positions` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Optional pre-fetched positions frame. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of polars. |
| `_get_fn` | `Optional[Callable[..., dict]]` | `None` | Injectable replacement for `nba_stats_leaguedashptstats`. |

**Returns**

One row per player-season: `season:Int64, player_id:Utf8, player_name:Utf8, team_id:Utf8, position_bucket:Utf8, gp:Int64, min:Float64, drives:Float64, drive_pts:Float64, drive_baseline_rate:Float64, drive_expected:Float64, drive_pts_oe:Float64, drive_pts_oe_per_36:Float64, drive_fta:Float64, rim_pressure:Float64, drive_ast:Float64, drive_tov:Float64, league_id:Utf8`. Empty/malformed input returns a zero-row frame with this schema.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it reads stats.nba.com, which answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on; the function works from a residential IP.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import nba_tracking_drive_value
df = nba_tracking_drive_value(2024)
print(df.sort("drive_pts_oe", descending=True).head())
```

### nba_tracking_pass_value {#nba_tracking_pass_value}

`nba_tracking_pass_value(seasons: "'int | str | list'", *, league_id: 'str' = '00', per_mode: 'str' = 'Totals', by_position: 'bool' = True, positions: 'Optional[pl.DataFrame]' = None, fetch_potential_assists: 'bool' = False, max_players: 'int' = 0, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False, _get_fn: 'Optional[Callable[..., dict]]' = None, _pass_get_fn: 'Optional[Callable[..., dict]]' = None) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

Expected-assists / passer value: `ast_oe` per player-season.

Fetches the `Passing` `leaguedashptstats` measure (one call) and computes
`ast_oe = ast - passes * bucket_assist_rate`. When
`fetch_potential_assists=True`, also fetches `nba_stats_playerdashptpass`
for the top-`max_players` passers (capped, optional -- never a hard
dependency) and recomputes the residual against the richer
`potential_assists` denominator for that subset; `max_players=0`
(default) makes exactly one request total. `ast_pts_created` is passed
through directly from the Passing measure (it is already computed there;
not re-derived).

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| str \| list` |  | A single season or list of seasons. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA (default), `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |
| `per_mode` | `str` | `'Totals'` | `per_mode_simple` passed to the fetch (default `"Totals"`). |
| `by_position` | `bool` | `True` | Compute the baseline within role buckets (default); `False` forces one league-wide bucket. |
| `positions` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Optional pre-fetched positions frame. |
| `fetch_potential_assists` | `bool` | `False` | Enrich the top passers with `playerdashptpass` potential-assist counts. |
| `max_players` | `int` | `0` | Cap on per-player enrichment fetches; `0` disables enrichment regardless of `fetch_potential_assists`. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of polars. |
| `_get_fn` | `Optional[Callable[..., dict]]` | `None` | Injectable replacement for `nba_stats_leaguedashptstats`. |
| `_pass_get_fn` | `Optional[Callable[..., dict]]` | `None` | Injectable replacement for `nba_stats_playerdashptpass`. |

**Returns**

One row per player-season: `season:Int64, player_id:Utf8, player_name:Utf8, team_id:Utf8, position_bucket:Utf8, gp:Int64, min:Float64, ast:Float64, passes:Float64, ast_baseline_rate:Float64, ast_expected:Float64, ast_oe:Float64, ast_oe_per_36:Float64, ast_pts_created:Float64, league_id:Utf8`. Empty/malformed input returns a zero-row frame with this schema.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it reads stats.nba.com, which answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on; the function works from a residential IP.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import nba_tracking_pass_value
df = nba_tracking_pass_value(2024)
print(df.sort("ast_oe", descending=True).head())

# With potential-assist enrichment for the top 50 passers

df = nba_tracking_pass_value(2024, fetch_potential_assists=True, max_players=50)
```

### nba_tracking_reb_oe {#nba_tracking_reb_oe}

`nba_tracking_reb_oe(seasons: "'int | str | list'", *, league_id: 'str' = '00', per_mode: 'str' = 'Totals', by_position: 'bool' = True, positions: 'Optional[pl.DataFrame]' = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False, _get_fn: 'Optional[Callable[..., dict]]' = None) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

Rebounding-over-expected: `reb_oe` plus OREB/DREB splits, per player-season.

Fetches the `Rebounding` `leaguedashptstats` measure, attaches a
`guard`/`wing`/`big` role bucket, and computes
`reb_oe = reb - reb_chances * bucket_rate` (contest-difficulty-adjusted
when the endpoint carries separate contested/uncontested CHANCE columns;
the live `stats.nba.com` payload currently does not, so this degrades
gracefully to the plain rate -- see the fixtures README for the finding).
OREB/DREB residuals are computed identically against their own chance
columns. Baselines are recomputed from the same season slice on every
call -- there is no fitted constant or bundled artifact.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| str \| list` |  | A single season (`int` ending-year or `"YYYY-YY"` string) or a list of seasons to concatenate. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA (default), `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |
| `per_mode` | `str` | `'Totals'` | `per_mode_simple` passed to the fetch (default `"Totals"`). |
| `by_position` | `bool` | `True` | Compute the baseline within `guard`/`wing`/`big` buckets (default). `False` forces one league-wide bucket. |
| `positions` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Optional pre-fetched positions frame (see `_attach_role_bucket`); mostly for injecting a fixture in tests. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of polars. |
| `_get_fn` | `Optional[Callable[..., dict]]` | `None` | Injectable replacement for `nba_stats_leaguedashptstats` returning the raw payload dict directly -- offline testing hook. |

**Returns**

One row per player-season: `season:Int64, player_id:Utf8, player_name:Utf8, team_id:Utf8, position_bucket:Utf8, gp:Int64, min:Float64, reb:Float64, reb_chances:Float64, reb_baseline_rate:Float64, reb_expected:Float64, reb_oe:Float64, reb_oe_per_36:Float64, oreb_oe:Float64, dreb_oe:Float64, league_id:Utf8`. Empty/malformed input returns a zero-row frame with this schema.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it reads stats.nba.com, which answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on; the function works from a residential IP.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import nba_tracking_reb_oe
df = nba_tracking_reb_oe(2024)
print(df.sort("reb_oe", descending=True).head())

# League-wide baseline (no position split)

df_all = nba_tracking_reb_oe(2024, by_position=False)

# Pandas output

df_pd = nba_tracking_reb_oe(2024, return_as_pandas=True)
```

### nba_tracking_rim_protect_value {#nba_tracking_rim_protect_value}

`nba_tracking_rim_protect_value(seasons: "'int | str | list'", *, league_id: 'str' = '00', per_mode: 'str' = 'Totals', by_position: 'bool' = True, positions: 'Optional[pl.DataFrame]' = None, source: 'str' = 'leaguedash', max_players: 'int' = 0, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False, _get_fn: 'Optional[Callable[..., dict]]' = None, _defend_get_fn: 'Optional[Callable[..., dict]]' = None) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

Rim-protection / shot-defend points-saved over expected, per player-season.

Fetches the `Defense` `leaguedashptstats` measure -- which on the live
`stats.nba.com` payload exposes only rim-band defended shooting
(`def_rim_fgm`/`def_rim_fga`/`def_rim_fg_pct`, no separate overall
figure -- see the fixtures README) -- and computes
`rim_protect_pts_saved = (normal_fg_pct - d_fg_pct) * d_fga * 2` where
`normal_fg_pct` is the bucket-mean defended rate (there is no
shooters'-own-average column on this endpoint, so the bucket mean is the
baseline; this is the same attempts-weighted construction as every other
model, just sign-flipped so a defender who holds shooters BELOW the
bucket mean gets a positive points-saved value).

`source="shotdefend"` swaps in the `Less-Than-6-Ft` band from
`nba_stats_playerdashptshotdefend` for the top-`max_players` defenders
by attempt volume (capped, optional -- never a hard dependency);
`max_players=0` (default) uses the leaguedash figures for everyone.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| str \| list` |  | A single season or list of seasons. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA (default), `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |
| `per_mode` | `str` | `'Totals'` | `per_mode_simple` passed to the fetch (default `"Totals"`). |
| `by_position` | `bool` | `True` | Compute the baseline within role buckets (default); `False` forces one league-wide bucket. |
| `positions` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Optional pre-fetched positions frame. |
| `source` | `str` | `'leaguedash'` | `"leaguedash"` (default) or `"shotdefend"`. |
| `max_players` | `int` | `0` | Cap on per-player `shotdefend` enrichment fetches; ignored unless `source="shotdefend"`. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of polars. |
| `_get_fn` | `Optional[Callable[..., dict]]` | `None` | Injectable replacement for `nba_stats_leaguedashptstats`. |
| `_defend_get_fn` | `Optional[Callable[..., dict]]` | `None` | Injectable replacement for `nba_stats_playerdashptshotdefend`. |

**Returns**

One row per player-season: `season:Int64, player_id:Utf8, player_name:Utf8, team_id:Utf8, position_bucket:Utf8, gp:Int64, min:Float64, d_fga:Float64, d_fgm:Float64, d_fg_pct:Float64, normal_fg_pct:Float64, rim_protect_pts_saved:Float64, rim_protect_pts_saved_per_36:Float64, source:Utf8, league_id:Utf8`. Empty/malformed input returns a zero-row frame with this schema.

df = nba_tracking_rim_protect_value(2024)
print(df.sort("rim_protect_pts_saved", descending=True).head())
```

### nba_tracking_shot_diet_value {#nba_tracking_shot_diet_value}

`nba_tracking_shot_diet_value(seasons: "'int | str | list'", *, league_id: 'str' = '00', per_mode: 'str' = 'Totals', by_position: 'bool' = True, positions: 'Optional[pl.DataFrame]' = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False, _get_fn: 'Optional[Callable[..., dict]]' = None) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

Catch-&-shoot vs pull-up points-over-expected, per player-season.

Fetches `CatchShoot` and `PullUpShot` (two calls), scores each with the
shared engine, joins on `player_id` (dtype-asserted `Utf8` both sides
first), and computes `shot_diet_delta = (cs_pts_oe / cs_fga) -
(pu_pts_oe / pu_fga)` (null-safe on zero attempts) -- positive means the
player's efficiency edge comes from catch-&-shoot, negative from
off-the-dribble.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| str \| list` |  | A single season or list of seasons. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA (default), `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |

**Returns**

One row per player-season: `season:Int64, player_id:Utf8, player_name:Utf8, team_id:Utf8, position_bucket:Utf8, cs_fga:Float64, cs_pts:Float64, cs_pts_oe:Float64, pu_fga:Float64, pu_pts:Float64, pu_pts_oe:Float64, shot_diet_delta:Float64, league_id:Utf8`.

`pts_per_touch_oe = pts - touches * bucket_pts_per_touch`.
`time_of_poss_eff` is the z-score of `pts / time_of_poss` within the
player's role bucket -- scoring economy per second of possession,
independent of touch volume.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |

| `seasons` | `int \| str \| list` |  | A single season or list of seasons. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA (default), `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |
| `per_mode` | `str` | `'Totals'` | `per_mode_simple` passed to the fetch (default `"Totals"`). |
