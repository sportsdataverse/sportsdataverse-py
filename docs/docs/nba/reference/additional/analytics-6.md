# NBA — additional Python functions — Analytics: nba_team–nba_tracking

### nba_team_season_rates {#nba_team_season_rates}

`nba_team_season_rates(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', season_type: 'str' = 'regular-season', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Season team rates from possessions: ORtg/DRtg/net, pace and the four factors, with splits.

One row per team, season and split (`all`, `home`, `away`, `close`, `clutch`).
Clutch is a possession in play with 5:00 or less left (starting there, or starting before 5:00
and ending after it; one that ends at exactly 5:00 is out) in the 4th quarter or an overtime, the
score within 5 as it starts (stats.nba.com's clutch window); a close game is one with a clutch
possession. For the WNBA (`league_id="10"`) through 2005, two 20-minute halves, the regulation
window is the last 5:00 of the 2nd half; overtime counts as above. The full definitions are in
`sportsdataverse._common.team_season_rates`.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2026` is 2025-26). The WNBA season is its calendar year. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA or `"10"` WNBA. |
| `season_type` | `str` | `'regular-season'` | `"regular-season"` (default), `"preseason"`, `"playoffs"` or `"play-in"`, matched to the schedule's `season_type`. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id, split)`. `team_id` is the stats.nba.com team id (Int64). `games`, `poss` / `opp_poss` (offensive / defensive possessions) and `pts` / `opp_pts` are the split's totals. The twelve rates are `off_rtg`, `def_rtg`, `net_rtg` (per 100 possessions), `pace` (possessions per 48 minutes, 40 in the WNBA), the four factors `efg_pct`, `tov_pct`, `orb_pct`, `ft_rate` and the same four against (`opp_*`), all fractions. Each rate has `<m>_rank` (1 = best; `def_rtg`, `tov_pct`, `opp_efg_pct`, `opp_orb_pct` and `opp_ft_rate` rank low first; pace ranks high first), `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile) and `<m>_n` (the sample: possessions for the ratings, the clock in regulation games for pace, field-goal attempts for eFG% and FT rate, possessions for turnover rate, rebound chances for ORB%). Ranks are within the season and split, among teams with at least half the most games whose `<m>_n` reaches the league's `~sportsdataverse._common.rate_gates.TEAM_MIN_N` gate (a clutch split reaches none), and null under five teams. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If `league_id` is not `"00"` or `"10"` (checked before any data is loaded). |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_shot_zone_profiles import nba_team_shot_zones
teams = nba_team_shot_zones(2025)
teams.sort("opp_rim_freq").select("team_id", "opp_rim_freq", "opp_rim_fg_pct").head()

# WNBA via ``league_id``

wnba = nba_team_shot_zones(2025, league_id="10")
```

### nba_team_strength {#nba_team_strength}

`nba_team_strength(seasons: 'int | list[int]', *, league_id: 'str' = '00', season_type: 'str' = 'regular-season', return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False) -> 'pl.DataFrame | pd.DataFrame'`

Team strength from possessions: adjusted ratings, SOS, SOV, pace and the four factors.

One row per team and season. The adjusted ratings are a ridge regression of points per 100
on each possession on offense, defense and home terms (penalty
`~sportsdataverse._common.team_strength.RIDGE_LAMBDA`, fit by season-disjoint CV):
points scored / allowed per 100 against an average opponent on a neutral court. SOS is the
mean opponent `adj_net_rtg` over the team's games, SOV the same over its wins.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| list[int]` |  | A season or list of seasons, named by the year it ends (`2026` is 2025-26). The WNBA season is its calendar year. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA or `"10"` WNBA. |
| `season_type` | `str` | `'regular-season'` | `"regular-season"` (default), `"preseason"`, `"playoffs"` or `"play-in"`, matched to the schedule's `season_type`. The ridge, the rates and the games all use it. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a pandas frame instead of polars. |

**Returns**

One row per `(season, team_id)`; `team_id` is the stats.nba.com team id (Int64). `games`, `poss` / `opp_poss`, `pts` / `opp_pts` are the season totals from the possessions; `wins` / `losses` come from the schedule's final scores. The rated metrics are `adj_off_rtg`, `adj_def_rtg`, `adj_net_rtg`, `sos`, `sov` and the BB-D3 rates (`off_rtg`, `def_rtg`, `net_rtg`, `pace`, the four factors and the four against). Each has `<m>_rank` (1 = best; `adj_def_rtg`, `def_rtg`, `tov_pct` and the opponent shooting, rebounding and free-throw rates rank low first; `sos` ranks the hardest schedule first), `<m>_pct` (the Weibull percentile) and `<m>_n` (possessions for the ratings, completed games against a rated opponent for SOS, the clock in regulation games for pace, wins over a rated opponent for SOV). Ranks are within the season, among teams with at least half the most games, the BB-D3 rates' also behind their `~sportsdataverse._common.rate_gates.TEAM_MIN_N` gate, and null under five teams. Empty input returns that schema with zero rows.

**Raises**

| Exception | Description |
|---|---|
| `ValueError` | If `league_id` is not `"00"` or `"10"`, or `season_type` is not one of the four above (checked before any data is loaded). |

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba.nba_team_strength import nba_team_strength
strength = nba_team_strength(2026)
strength.sort("adj_net_rtg_rank").select("team_id", "adj_net_rtg", "sos", "sov").head()

# WNBA via ``league_id``

wnba = nba_team_strength(2025, league_id="10")
```

### nba_tracking_drive_value {#nba_tracking_drive_value}

`nba_tracking_drive_value(seasons: "'int | str | list'", *, league_id: 'str' = '00', per_mode: 'str' = 'Totals', by_position: 'bool' = True, positions: 'Optional[pl.DataFrame]' = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False, _get_fn: 'Optional[Callable[..., dict]]' = None) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

Drive value over expected + rim-pressure, per player-season.

Fetches the `Drives` `leaguedashptstats` measure and computes
`drive_pts_oe = drive_pts - drives * bucket_pts_per_drive`. `rim_pressure`
is the z-score of `drive_fta / drives` within the player's role bucket
(a proxy for foul-drawing pressure independent of scoring efficiency).
`drive_ast`/`drive_tov` are passed through unchanged.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| str \| list` |  | A single season or list of seasons. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA (default), `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |
| `per_mode` | `str` | `'Totals'` | `per_mode_simple` passed to the fetch (default `"Totals"`). |
| `by_position` | `bool` | `True` | Compute the baseline within role buckets (default); `False` forces one league-wide bucket. |
| `positions` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Optional pre-fetched positions frame. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of polars. |
| `_get_fn` | `Optional[Callable[..., dict]]` | `None` | Injectable replacement for `nba_stats_leaguedashptstats`. |

**Returns**

One row per player-season: `season:Int64, player_id:Utf8, player_name:Utf8, team_id:Utf8, position_bucket:Utf8, gp:Int64, min:Float64, drives:Float64, drive_pts:Float64, drive_baseline_rate:Float64, drive_expected:Float64, drive_pts_oe:Float64, drive_pts_oe_per_36:Float64, drive_fta:Float64, rim_pressure:Float64, drive_ast:Float64, drive_tov:Float64, league_id:Utf8`. Empty/malformed input returns a zero-row frame with this schema.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it reads stats.nba.com, which answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on; the function works from a residential IP.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import nba_tracking_drive_value
df = nba_tracking_drive_value(2024)
print(df.sort("drive_pts_oe", descending=True).head())
```

### nba_tracking_pass_value {#nba_tracking_pass_value}

`nba_tracking_pass_value(seasons: "'int | str | list'", *, league_id: 'str' = '00', per_mode: 'str' = 'Totals', by_position: 'bool' = True, positions: 'Optional[pl.DataFrame]' = None, fetch_potential_assists: 'bool' = False, max_players: 'int' = 0, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False, _get_fn: 'Optional[Callable[..., dict]]' = None, _pass_get_fn: 'Optional[Callable[..., dict]]' = None) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

Expected-assists / passer value: `ast_oe` per player-season.

Fetches the `Passing` `leaguedashptstats` measure (one call) and computes
`ast_oe = ast - passes * bucket_assist_rate`. When
`fetch_potential_assists=True`, also fetches `nba_stats_playerdashptpass`
for the top-`max_players` passers (capped, optional -- never a hard
dependency) and recomputes the residual against the richer
`potential_assists` denominator for that subset; `max_players=0`
(default) makes exactly one request total. `ast_pts_created` is passed
through directly from the Passing measure (it is already computed there;
not re-derived).

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| str \| list` |  | A single season or list of seasons. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA (default), `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |
| `per_mode` | `str` | `'Totals'` | `per_mode_simple` passed to the fetch (default `"Totals"`). |
| `by_position` | `bool` | `True` | Compute the baseline within role buckets (default); `False` forces one league-wide bucket. |
| `positions` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Optional pre-fetched positions frame. |
| `fetch_potential_assists` | `bool` | `False` | Enrich the top passers with `playerdashptpass` potential-assist counts. |
| `max_players` | `int` | `0` | Cap on per-player enrichment fetches; `0` disables enrichment regardless of `fetch_potential_assists`. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of polars. |
| `_get_fn` | `Optional[Callable[..., dict]]` | `None` | Injectable replacement for `nba_stats_leaguedashptstats`. |
| `_pass_get_fn` | `Optional[Callable[..., dict]]` | `None` | Injectable replacement for `nba_stats_playerdashptpass`. |

**Returns**

One row per player-season: `season:Int64, player_id:Utf8, player_name:Utf8, team_id:Utf8, position_bucket:Utf8, gp:Int64, min:Float64, ast:Float64, passes:Float64, ast_baseline_rate:Float64, ast_expected:Float64, ast_oe:Float64, ast_oe_per_36:Float64, ast_pts_created:Float64, league_id:Utf8`. Empty/malformed input returns a zero-row frame with this schema.

No returns table is published for this function: no capture: it reads stats.nba.com, which answers HTTP 403 to the datacenter IP the docs are built on; the function works from a residential IP.

**Example**

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import nba_tracking_pass_value
df = nba_tracking_pass_value(2024)
print(df.sort("ast_oe", descending=True).head())

# With potential-assist enrichment for the top 50 passers

df = nba_tracking_pass_value(2024, fetch_potential_assists=True, max_players=50)
```

### nba_tracking_reb_oe {#nba_tracking_reb_oe}

`nba_tracking_reb_oe(seasons: "'int | str | list'", *, league_id: 'str' = '00', per_mode: 'str' = 'Totals', by_position: 'bool' = True, positions: 'Optional[pl.DataFrame]' = None, return_as_pandas: 'bool' = False, _get_fn: 'Optional[Callable[..., dict]]' = None) -> "'Union[pl.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]'"`

Rebounding-over-expected: `reb_oe` plus OREB/DREB splits, per player-season.

Fetches the `Rebounding` `leaguedashptstats` measure, attaches a
`guard`/`wing`/`big` role bucket, and computes
`reb_oe = reb - reb_chances * bucket_rate` (contest-difficulty-adjusted
when the endpoint carries separate contested/uncontested CHANCE columns;
the live `stats.nba.com` payload currently does not, so this degrades
gracefully to the plain rate -- see the fixtures README for the finding).
OREB/DREB residuals are computed identically against their own chance
columns. Baselines are recomputed from the same season slice on every
call -- there is no fitted constant or bundled artifact.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seasons` | `int \| str \| list` |  | A single season (`int` ending-year or `"YYYY-YY"` string) or a list of seasons to concatenate. |
| `league_id` | `str` | `'00'` | `"00"` NBA (default), `"10"` WNBA, `"20"` G-League. |
| `per_mode` | `str` | `'Totals'` | `per_mode_simple` passed to the fetch (default `"Totals"`). |
| `by_position` | `bool` | `True` | Compute the baseline within `guard`/`wing`/`big` buckets (default). `False` forces one league-wide bucket. |
| `positions` | `Optional[DataFrame]` | `None` | Optional pre-fetched positions frame (see `_attach_role_bucket`); mostly for injecting a fixture in tests. |
| `return_as_pandas` | `bool` | `False` | Return a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of polars. |
| `_get_fn` | `Optional[Callable[..., dict]]` | `None` | Injectable replacement for `nba_stats_leaguedashptstats` returning the raw payload dict directly -- offline testing hook. |

**Returns**

One row per player-season: `season:Int64, player_id:Utf8, player_name:Utf8, team_id:Utf8, position_bucket:Utf8, gp:Int64, min:Float64, reb:Float64, reb_chances:Float64, reb_baseline_rate:Float64, reb_expected:Float64, reb_oe:Float64, reb_oe_per_36:Float64, oreb_oe:Float64, dreb_oe:Float64, league_id:Utf8`. Empty/malformed input returns a zero-row frame with this schema.

```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import nba_tracking_reb_oe
df = nba_tracking_reb_oe(2024)
print(df.sort("reb_oe", descending=True).head())

# League-wide baseline (no position split)

# Pandas output

df_pd = nba_tracking_reb_oe(2024, return_as_pandas=True)
```
